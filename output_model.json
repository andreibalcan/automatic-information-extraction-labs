It is located about --mins walk from the walk of fame and graumanns chinese theatre and is on most of the tour companie's pick up routes. Our room was nice and big and was very clean. Breakfast was included and it was really nice, the usual toast, cereal, pastries and cooked things. You also get free use of their internet in the business centre, as well as the gym and pool. The reception staff were really helpful in givin us directions etc. There is a minimart, subway and starbucks just across the road which is convenient. Also just off the walk of fame is a shopping mall with shops like Gap, Superdry, etc. There are also a few restaurants there as well. For anyone who likes pizzas I would recommend visiting the California Pizza Kitchen at the mall - pizzas are lush there and are rasonably priced. We got a shared bus to the hotel through Super Shuttle. It cost approx $-- return and pick ups occur every ----- mins from airport. Be warned of the way they drive tho, it was a slightly frightening experience after -- hours on a plane! \r\nWe didnt have a car there so did all organised tours, one through VIP tours and one through Starline Tours. The VIP tour was a tour of LA including Hollywood, Venice Beach, Downtown LA and Beverly HIlls. This lasted approx --- day and was really worth the money. We then did an escorted trip to Universal with Starline which was well organised and Universal is worth visiting!! We also went to Madame Tussauds on the walk of fame which had some good and bad statues!!\r\nOverall though the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame is worth staying at, its clean, convenient and has some nice free extras thrown in!!",

The quality, size, quietness, and location of the room was supurb. Every staff member was friendly and willing to help. Complimentary wine reception every evening was a definite plus. We felt comfortable from the moment we arrived and were reluctant to leave. The Muse is a calm oasis in the bustle of New York City. As a Kimpton InTouch member we were upgraded automatically to a superior king room. It was large well appointed and quiet with a view down --th street. The bed was extremely comfortable. They just began a complete renovation of the lobby so there may be some inconvenience until it is completed. Our only bad experience was the District Restaurant. We ate there Sunday for breakfast. Service was mediocre, the bacon and eggs were both overcooked and it was tremendously over priced. Such a fine hotel should not have such a bad restaurant. Other than that I would recommend this hotel very highly.",

			"originalText": "I booked three nights at the Inn at El Gaucho based on the reviews from tripadvisor.com. When my boyfriend and I arrived after a - hour flight from NY, we were happy that the Inn is located only -- minutes from the airport by taxi. The hotel is located on the second floor of a steakhouse, with no elevator and no bellhop, so we had to carry our bags up a flight and a half of stairs. (I knew about this from the reviews, but after a long flight I had forgotten!) The woman at the front desk was very helpful, even leaving to personally check if the room was ready because we had arrived early for check-in. It was, and she gave us a large cold bottle of Evian, a goodie bag with large cookies and a CD, and a short tour of our room and its amenities. We were also given - room keys, which is helpful. \r\nThe room was a suite (they are all suites) facing -st Avenue. The bed looked like one large pillow and it was amazingly soft and comfortable. We had to force ourselves, after testing it, to get up and do some exploring around town. The room had a --\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" TV which came in handy because we were there to see the Seahawks VS. Giants that Sunday at Quest Field Stadium, so we were able to keep track of the teams and highlights on a picture-perfect TV. The bathroom had a stall shower and was pretty basic - hairdryer, lots of towels, and complimentary toileties. The room closet had a dresser, iron and board, and - ultra-soft bathrobes. There was also a seperate coffee-office closet which was pretty convenient, yet out of the way. And the leather sofa and chair were nice, as well. The most useful thing in the room was the pile of Seattle guides on the sofa table. We used that to find all the restaurants for our entire stay. \r\nThe Inn is located only a half mile from Seattle Center (with Space Needle) and less than a mile striaight down -st to Pike Market. It's only a little further to Pioneer Square and Quest Field Stadium. And it's only - blocks away from the Seattle Port. First Avenue has an abundance of restaurants and shops so you won't have to worry about taking a taxi to dinner. (There's even a big umbrella for you in the room closet, just in case you have to take a short walk in the rain!) \r\nOverall, we were so happy with our choice that when we go back to Seattle for whatever reason, we will be staying there. The location, the comfort, the moderate price ($--- a night in Seattle is hard to beat) and the friendliness of the female employees made it a perfect stay!",

Pool didn't look too bad either but we didn't use it. WE had drinks at the bar and the bartenders were great. We went to see a show so we took a cab. When we got back later that night they had a DJ in the lobby so we had a few martinis. We went back up the room and ordered room service which was just find until there was a long blonde hair actually inside my burger which ruined the meal. The next day we had breakfast in the lobby restaurant which was excellent, and then we went to the spa and each had an -- minute treatment that was excellent. The spa was very nice and I took advantage of all the locker room amenities. Overall it was very nice, minus the roomservice mishap. The rooms are very modern but clean.

Yes, the location is slightly away from the main flow of traffic but that is what made it great for me. Quiet area. Short taxi ride to MP was fine with me as well. Took orange line from Midway, got off at the Library stop and short walk to hotel. Right across the street is a Ginos so if you need your fill of Chicago deep dish, Ginos is there to assist. \r\nThe hotel is quaint. Older buildings which have been merged to house the rooms. Very good service from check in to check out. At night, a bar is beside the lobby area with comfortable seating. Very relaxing space. As for the room, I was a large room with a King bed. Clean. The bed was very comfortable with crisp linens. Decor was fresh. View out of the window was the brick wall of the building next door. Did not bother me as I was only in the room to sleep and do some end of the day work. The bath was also very good size with a walk in shower....very nice. Another reviewer noted the rain head for the shower and low pressure. I will take the other side of the commentary. The pressure in the shower was very good and I loved the oversized rain head. If you did not like the downward stream, you could direct it slightly to get more of a traditional shower experience. I liked it so much, I am adding one to my soon the be remodeled bath. The only negative about the shower was the caulking had some mold. Maintenance needs to scrap out the old and replace with a tan colored caulk. \r\nOverall, I am very pleased with the property and would stay there again without hesitation.",

I've stayed in Manhattan more times than I can count - this is by FAR the best hotel experience I've had (sorry Ritz.)\r\nWe were upgraded to the Penthouse level (yay Hyatt rewards program!). Oh-em-gee .... a roof patio! The room was gigantic - especially by NY standards. The lounge is awesome and I'm in love with their espresso machine. The concierge was very helpful and we had a few ideas where we wanted to dine the last night and Eataly was great experience. She suggested it for a unique experience over the hotel restaurant. \r\nMost of all - the staff went above and beyond. Jordan was so awesome - he handled our check in (room wasn't quite ready, so he had us relax in the lounge while he handled check in) and he risked life and limb during an epic thunderstorm on our -nd day to score us a taxi to get to an appointment on time. \r\nI will not think twice when booking my next hotel in NYC - Hyatt -- Lex is terrific hotel and excellent value. Yes, you can find cheaper hotels. But I found it to be terrific value for NYC and we enjoyed the amenities. Wow. Such an outstanding experience and I can't wait to return.",

What I loved the most was smelling the fresh sheets. I felt like I was in a laundry commercial. I could not stop smelling the fresh linens. The city view was perfect although I must say Philly skyline looks better in the day than night. Their free breakfast was really like a mini-buffet, notice I did not say continental. It was really huge, or at least larger than other hotel chain's continental breakfast. I don't eat pork and I was able to get cheese eggs. The free internet was crazy fast. Checking in and out was a breeze. The entire staff was very helpful and I would stay again. \r\nThe Bad - I arrived -:-- (-- mins early) although check-in is -pm. I didn't mind the room was not ready then but was bothered that it was not ready until -:-- (-- mins late). The heater is not central based meaning you have to control it yourself and the vent was extremely loud. I opted many times to just not run it because it was just too loud to sit through. \r\nThe Ugly - After coming in one night, there were people hanging out next to the elevator and wall with no shoes on. I assume they were maybe taking a break from their room however the hotel does have a lobby for that. It was not a good site to see shoe-less guests hanging out on the wall and at the elevator. On my last night, I was awaken at -am by rude guest who had been [--] the entire trip. After going back to sleep, I was then awaken by hammering. The hotel is renovating a little.

The doormen were very attentive too. \r\nIt was when you entered the lifts that the bright and airy feel dissapeared. The lift was very nice and oppulent but dark, once up to the --th floor, we were met with a very dark, slightly creepy in a nice way corridor. This hotel must have just been renovated because everything was immaculate.\r\nOur room was a surprise, it was quite big and even though the decor was a little busy, we did like it, the bathroom was large, with good qaulity fixtures. The bath towels and robes were light and fluffy and the tioletries were replaced everyday. The soaps they use a lovely too, and WOW what a great shower. \r\nThe room itself had a very large flat screen TV mounted on the wall, we also had a floor to ceiling mirror on one wall and floor to ceiling windows. The bed was super-king size and the bed was very comfortable. As we are super fussy on bed quality we did make sure the beds were pillow-top and it was like a big marshmellow.\r\nAll the fixtures and fittings, looked to be brand new. Be warned though as some of the mini bar items, water, ect, snacks are placed on the tray with your glasses and cocktail shakers and they are not free. \r\nWe did have room service once and it was good and reasonably priced. We ate at Bin-- for breakfast a few times and found it very nice indeed.\r\nThere is a new Bar called The Crimson Lounge, gosh this place looked like a Vampire's Lure, very gothic, red and so dark, you could hardly see the person sat next to you on some tables. It was very busy on the weekend we where there, with lots of young girls aged around -- - --, dressed to impress, not our cup of tea really.\r\nWe did like Chicago, not so much as NY but we managed to see lots of sights. \r\nHarry Carays is a nice Bar ect. We also at at SMith and Wollensky but to be honest the over bearing waiter really put ut off. \r\nALl in all the Sax is very well placed in the Marina, right next to the House Of Blues, were you can watch blues and eat good food, we managed to go on Sunday for the Brunch and gospel Choir, was fantastic and en experience. \r\nOur only gripe was our view out of the windows, of the Corn Cob Towers, the car park hosts the first -- floors, so being on floor --, we had a view of the spiral car park and also the noise. \r\nHowever all in all it was a great hotel and well worth the money.",

We didn't take their advice and ended up being seriously underwhelmed by Old Town and its surroundings. Instead, visit Coronado Island if you have a free afternoon during your conference.

After learning that this was a top rated hotel in Philly, I decided to give it a try. Everything was perfect, and the staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful! The room was very clean, modern, a good size, and ours had a nice view of the city. The hotel is in the Rittenhouse Square area, which has excellent restaurants and shopping. And they offered several perks for our stay - a later checkout time, a place to store our luggage after checkout (so my wife and I could spend more time in the city), and restaurant recommendations. They even left us two bottles of water and popcorn in our car, when it was picked up from valet parking! The wine reception they hold every night in the lobby is also a nice treat, and a great way to be welcomed to this unique hotel.",

Inspite of this, she provided great service. The bottle of wine upon check-in is a nice touch.\r\nFood: the continental breakfast was fantastic and was one of my favorite aspects of the hotel. The continental breakfast offered nice variety and the fool was delicious. The woman who tended to the breakfast was friendly and efficient; she provided great service.\r\nValue: Truly, the only issue I had with the hotel was the price. It's an expensive hotel for what one receives. My wife and I have been fortunate to travel and stay in some great hotels worldwide and it seems in our travels; we have experienced more for what we paid for at other hotels than what we paid for at the Henderson's Wharf Inn.

			"originalText": "I had stayed the Elysee's sister property the Casablanca in June and really liked it and decided to try the Elysee because of the location in midtown. This was going to a quick -- hour trip from LA to NYC so I e-mailed the hotel ahead of time and requested a room at the back of the hotel as I'm a very light sleeper, and with the trip being so short I was really hoping they would me able to accommodate me. I had booked a deluxe king room. While checking in I was told that I had been upgraded to a one bedroom suite at the back of the hotel. I felt like reaching across the counter and planting one on the nice young man! I was escorted up to my suite and absolutely giddy with delight as this never happens to me. The suite was spectacular! The living room was very large for NYC standards and had a plasma tv in the armoire. The bedroom was equally large and spacious and the bathroom was done in marble. I only wished my stay was to be longer than -- hours.\r\nThe complimentary breakfast can be delivered to your room for only $-. I called and requested this service in the morning and it was brought immediately up which consisted of a large pot of coffee, bagels, and fruit. I tipped the deliveryman and dug in! I couldn't believe what incredible service I was getting. \r\nThe wine and cheese in the evening was generous and relaxing. The free wi-fi in the room was also very much appreciated.\r\nWhat sets the Elysee apart is the staff. Each request or inquiry was met with a professional response. The hotel is boutique style so its very intimate and the staff addresses you on a first name basis, making it feel like home. \r\nI travel to NYC quite a bit for business and pleasure and I have tried them all, but this will be my new home away from home. The abundant complimentary breakfast, wine and cheese and free wi-fi make the Elysee such a great value. And no, its not cheap, but what is in NYC? If you add in the complimentary services and the fantastic staff the Elysee simply can't be beat. And thanks again to everyone who made my stay so effortless. Only wish I could have stayed in the suite for a week!",

Only issues we had were on the deal we booked as there seemed to be a catch to each of the offerings... perhaps their marketing was a little bit more generous than the actual offerings were in reality. - night free was great, except that they charge you for that night anyway upfront then credit back to you several days after you leave... not the best if you didn't plan on taking that money out of your wallet on a family trip (we booked - rooms, so the extra charge was $---). Breakfast credit sounded great except that a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"hot\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" buffet was $-- for one person and if you ordered a la carte it was still going to add up to roughly $-- each. We had - total people, - adults, - kids and it was all we could do to keep the bill under $--- each morning for breakfast. If the breakfast was actually good I wouldn't have minded but it was lacking to say the least. Matter of fact the free items in the lobby were just as good and FREE! lol. I do not recommend eating here if you're staying, complete rip off. Mini bar in the room was a nice touch, everything but the alcohol was free.

Other than that, the rest was good. Rooms do offer limited privacy in the bathroom area though as the toilet glass door is mirrored but the shower door has no frosting or mirror to block spectators. Good if you're with your spouse, bad if you have kids in the room. :)\r\nOverall I'd recommend it if you can get it for the rates we did as it's nice and in a good location on Wall and Water.

Great, polite, accomodating service without the snooty attitude common at so many other famous places; small and intimate ambience- the doormen will remember you! ; understated and classy lobby and bar; great location. Despite recent renovation still feels like Dorothy Parker would be at home here. \r\nYes the rooms and baths are small, but the beds are as comfortable as any ritzy resort and, after all, its New York. You aren't going to stay in your hotel room all day anyway are you?\r\nIf you like modern, soulless box hotels or snotty must-be-seen places- go elsewhere.

Being that is was my first time going I didn’t know were and what hotel to choose from I came across The Opal, it had reasonable prices online and was able to book with them over the phone with “Nick” very nice and informative. I had remembered after the fact that I have AAA and called customer service to find out if they give discounts they told me yes I would just show my card when I check in and get the discount. My posse and I got there at -am in the morning as I’m checking in the lady tells me they have no more parking and will have to park a block away, I was annoyed at the fact that if I booked - Jr. suites they should have enough parking to accommodate the cars arriving. I then ask about the AAA discount the lady tells me she can’t override the price only a manager can and he comes in the morning. I was upset and tired that I opted to fix the problem in the morning. We get into our rooms they are not what expected for Jr. Suites small rooms we had to rearrange our sleeping arrangements. The next morning I spoke with a very pleasant rep “Angela” at the front desk I explain the situation of the parking and AAA, she begins by apologizing she tells me how the discount works which is not how I was told over the phone the -nd time; I was unable to get the AAA discount but I did get - days of free parking worth $-- a day and a bottle of wine for my birthday which I was very satisfied with. She also was very helpful in giving us recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the city. I didn’t have any problems after that as a matter of fact the last day of check out was fast and easy “Carlo” checked us out told us how to get to the Golden Gate Bridge. I realized a day later on our drive back that I forgot my dress and my boyfriends dress shirt in the closest. I called right away they have a lost and found rep “Miriam” she was polite and helpful she said they did have it I asked if they would be able to ship it to me with no hesitation she said of course we can do that for you. I now have my belongings and back home with great memories to look back on.",

			"originalText": "This hotel is what you would generally expect a Homewood Suites to be like. The staff was very friendly from check-in to check-out of my two week stay. Breakfast was usually hot, and there was always enough food out. There is a Manager's Reception each Monday-Thursday night like at all Homewood's, but I did not attend one of those so I can't comment on the quality. The rooms are awesome. I was fortunate enough to be able to book a fireplace suite. They provide you one firelog for free, but any remaining logs you must buy yourself. They do sell them at the front desk, but if you are going to use more than - I would simply buy them from the nearby Target or Walmart for cheaper. The suite was very spacious. The bedroom itself is the size of your common hotel room. The living area have both a semi-comfortable chair, and a not so comfortable at all couch. The kitchens are equipped with a stove top and microwave, but there is no oven which I find to be a negative. At the very least, a convection oven combined with the microwave would be nice. You will not have a problem finding a place to store your luggage as there are plenty of closets and two sets of drawers. My room also had a patio which would be a nice addition for the Summer months. Some very important advice is that there is a railroad track that runs adjacent to this property. If you are a HiltonHonors member, you are given to option to select your room before you arrive. Rooms on the South side of the property and on the East side of the property are ones to stay away from if you are a light sleeper. My room was in the Southeast corner of the property (the absolute worst place) so I could actually feel the floors shake when the trains went by. Luckily I am not a light sleeper. As far as location, it is a short drive to several restaurants and a great shopping mall. Of course, not all business travelers have the luxury of a rental car so it is nice to be able to walk to restaurants. Well, that will not happen if you stay here. However, they do provide a shuttle that will take you anywhere within a - mile radius. I did not use the shuttle, so I can't comment on how convenient it is. Overall, this is definitely an excellent place to stay for the price. If you are familiar with the Homewood Suites brand, this property will not disappoint. Just stay away from the South and East side of the property and you will have nothing to complain about.",

The decorum is definitely fashion over function but in the end we didn't feel comfort had been sacrificed for aesthetics. \r\nOur room was on the fourth floor overlooking West --th but we didn't experience any noise problems from the street below. The bedroom was typical in size for NYC, enough room for bed, furnishings, and space to maneuver. The bathroom was close to equal in size with the bedroom with a full shower and a wall shelf for toiletries. The bed was firm but comfortable, the closet and drawers provided plenty of storage space, and the lighting could be adjusted from subtle to extremely bright as needed. \r\nWe visited the bar and ordered a cheese plate (rather plain) and drinks (fresh and delicious). The prices were typical for a hotel bar but the service was friendlier and more attentive than most we've visited. The bar is small but open to the street so there was still plenty to see.\r\nWhile we stayed here we visited MOMA and attended a concert at the Beacon Theater. We had no problems walking from the hotel to the subway or nearby destinations. We did check our luggage at the front desk for a short period and had no trouble retrieving it later.",

Parking is covered and convenient and the neighbourhood is safe and quiet.\r\nThe staff were wonderful, especially Wyatt, who despite seeming to be doing every job under the sun when we were checking in, took time to accomodate our needs and was really smiley and helpful (as were all the staff we met without exception).\r\nThe room was lovely; a two room unit on the seventh floor overlooking the downtown area and the mountains. The bedroom was generously sized, the bed huge and comfortable and the a-c nice and chilly! The main living area shared both the view and balcony and was comfortably furnished. The bonus of it's former life as an appartment block is the sheer amount of space you get for your money - lovely to have been able to have really spread out.\r\nI would be the first to admit that it is perhaps a little outdated and worn in places (but certainly not unstylish) in some of it's furnishings but that somehow added to it's comfortable homely charms! \r\nIn summary, if I could live there, I would!",

As others have said, the full-wall width mirrors are a little weird, as are the TVs mounted on top of a closet-type cabinet. I guess there was a pool and a fitness room, but I didn't use either. I was surprised they put me in a double-queen room when I was by myself. The bed was comfortable and clean, as was the bathroom. It was VERY quiet (a pleasant surprise). I checked in fairly late (-- pm) and the night clerk was friendly and efficient. Parking was a little difficult (crowded), but I found a spot. I did the 'park and fly' thing - there was NO extra charge. The breakfast left a bit to be desired, but for what I paid, it wasn't bad. I parked for - days and simply called when I came back into town and the shuttle picked me up within -- minutes. I will DEFINITELY do this again to save on the stress of driving and parking the morning of an early flight. For less than the cost of parking at DIA for - days, I got a night at a hotel AND parking.

They have a very nice lobby-lounge where they have complimentary drinks all day (and wine in the evening). We were all upgraded to suites and the rooms were magnificent and the beds are probably THE most comfortable I've ever slept in! The decor is very modern and sleek. I have to say that one of the manager's (Iris) is so friendly and accommodating - you cannot go wrong if you are lucky enough to get to work with her on anything you might need. \r\nI'm also a photographer and often shoot in hotel rooms, so after staying here for the wedding I thought this would be an absolute PERFECT hotel to shoot at; I booked my room for a few weekends later, and once again, it was a perfect stay, the the perfect place to shoot!!

			"originalText": "My son and I stayed here over spring break. I got a room here at a very good price - almost as low as the cost of a nearby hostel. The room was very clean. I read a few reviews that said the rooms were small, but considering the size of an apartment in NYC, I didn't think it was that small. We had two double beds, and if we had been traveling with a third person, we probably could have squeezed in a rollaway bed. The bathroom was very clean and looked like it had been recently updated. \r\nA couple of cons - there was no screen on the window. We were on the --th floor and the window opened all the way, but there was no screen or any other safety feature. The bottom of the window is about -.- feet off the floor, so I kept having panic thoughts of my son (who was -- YEARS old at the time) tripping and falling out the window...a little paranoia there. lol However, I would not recommend this for someone traveling with a small child. Also, I could have sworn the rooms were advertised as having air conditioning. This one did not. I'm guessing they put window units in during the summer, but since it was still March, they hadn't put them in yet (it was unseasonably warm while we were there). That's just my guess, anyway.\r\nThe other thing that was a little odd was that the door lock looked like it had been broken before. I suppose if someone is really paraniod, this might be an issue. However, they have someone at the front desk -- hours a day. As a matter of fact, when you go out, they ask that you give them your room key and they will give it back when you return. Unheard of in this day, but it was kind of cool because you get to know the front desk people and they get to know you. They will ask for ID if they don't recognize you, but otherwise, they'll just give you your key. Again, I suppose if someone is super paranoid, this might be an issue, but I felt very safe there - more safe than staying at a motel with outside entry in the middle of nowhere. \r\nAlso, if you're not used to sleeping in a noisy city, I would recommend bringing ear plugs. The windows are super thin and you can hear traffic and people ALL NIGHT - it is only a couple of blocks from Time Square, so be prepared for traffic noise. I actually slept with a white noise track on my MP- player all night, and as soon as I dozed off, I didn't notice the noise anymore.\r\nAside from these small issues, I thought it was a great place, and I would definitely recommend it. They have a couple of nice lobby areas, one of which has a couple of dining tables, as well as a room with large lockers for rent for $-.

She gave us an upgraded room without asking (as we are Gold HHonors members). She also gave us information about the hotel to make our stay pleasant.\r\nWe used bell service at arrival and departure, each time having Victor help us with our luggage. What a professional, courteous man he is. He was at our door within - minutes of calling for bell service on our departure.\r\nOther delightful experiences included a fruit-snack basket delivered to us once we were settled into our room. Also the Executive floor lounge was comfortable and well attended. We had plentiful hors d'oeuvres the first evening, and a great breakfast the next morning. If you wanted, you could make a great meal of either offering. \r\nAs for the accommodations, our room was top notch. Everything was clean, stocked, and beautiful.

			"originalText": "My wife and I stayed one night at the fairly new JW Marriott in Indianapolis in mid-July. We normally stay at the Conrad what visiting Indy but decided to try out the new hotel. \r\nThe hotel is over-sized - probably -X the size of the Conrad. Almost reminds one of a Vegas-style hotel. The styling of the hotel is very modern-eclectic - it stands in sharp contrast to the more conservative and traditional Conrad styling. I personally prefer the Conrad but I'm sure others will prefer the JW. The JW lobby is loud and busy - Conrad is quiet and reserved.\r\nThe service was generally pretty good - however, the luggage did take over -- minutes to get to the room. I finally went down stairs to retrieve the luggage at which point the bell man brought it up. We did not order room service or eat at the restaurants so we got little exposure to the service other than the valet, which was fine.\r\nThe room view was spectacular. We were on the top floor and had an end room - two walls with floor to ceiling glass. Amazing. This is one area that the Conrad can not complete with JW - the views. Otherwise, the room was like the lobby - more modern in design. The office chair looks like something from my parents --'s kitchen. Take note: the bathroom does NOT have a tub - least not in our room. Also, the room did not have a couch (which you get at the Conrad) although there is room for one. But overall the room was very nice, beds were comfortable.\r\nThe pool is very small - smaller than Conrad and I do not like the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"raised\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" design of the pool. Hot tub was nice sized and the excerise facility was very large. One area where the Conrad is obviously superior to the JW is the changing-shower facilities for the pools and excercise rooms. There is no comparison. Conrad feels like an exclusive golf club with dry-wet sauna, multiple showers, many free amenities etc. The JW feels like a public changing area with no saunas and few free amenities. The Conrad comes equipped with robes and they are nowhere in sight at the JW. \r\nThe presence of a Starbucks in the meetings area is a nice feature.\r\nOverall, the new JW is a great new hotel in Indy but my vote is still that Conrad is a distant first. If you are an executive used to high-end treatment, it's my opinion the JW probably will not quite satisfy like the Conrad.",

This hotel was picked for me because it was across the street from the building where the office I was visiting was located. Good location for me, but I don't know if I'd pick this spot if I was a tourist. It was nice to be near the food court at the Liberty Place and the other restaurants around within walking distance, but most of the tourist stuff wasn't around where I was located. \r\nThe service was great. Everyone from the front door staff to the folks at the front desk to the people with guest services-room service were very nice. On a couple of different occasions, my room key failed to work, and the staff was great about having new cards programmed for me so I didn't have to wait too long. Prices through room service and down at the restaurant were a little steep, but probably not much different from other big cities. \r\nIn general, I'd say room cleanliness was pretty good. There were a couple of questionable stains on the wall near the bed, as well as a couple on sheets-pillowcases on certain days. Also, there was one day where I found a wash cloth with a red spot. I tossed it on the floor, assuming housekeeping would replace it. The next day when I picked up a new wash cloth from the counter, I found another red spot...surprisinly similar to the one from the previous day. No proof it was indeed the same...but no proof it wasn't.\r\nThe heavenly beds are still pretty good...not as fantastic as I remember from my last Westin stay, but since I wasn't getting a ton of sleep at night anyway, it wasn't really mattering much.\r\nI had a corporate rate of $----night, which I guess isn't terrible, but if you're paying much over this, I think I'd look for something in a better part of town with more people out and about at night if that's your thing.",

Got a spa treatment and it was wonderful and relaxing. The spa and fitness center are a must do. There is a walking trail around the property that is great to take advantage of. Tennis courts as well. The pool areas are fun, tropical setting. Can order snack food and drinks at the pool bar. Had breakfast one morning in their restaurant and no complaints, typical hotel breakfast but good. Also had a glass of wine in the bar area one night and perfectly fine as well. The atmosphere and service in both instances were great. I would love to find a reason to come back and stay at the Houstonian. Great for business and a weekend get away.

He had me go over the car to make sure that there weren't any scratches on the car and asked if we needed a luggage cart to our room. The only downside is that valet is $-- per day, but to me it was well worth it and I knew my car was being kept somewhere safe for being in a major city. The lobby was very well decorated, and we were greeted warmly by the front desk staff. He asked us the reason for our stay and I mentioned that we were there for a night out with a group of friends in the area. He even gave us free passes to a local bar at the Power Plant Live area. Our room was very clean and it still smelled like the cleaner when we walked in! The beds were also very comfy. There was a nice sized flat screen TV and the bathroom was also very clean and a deent size. We were attending a concert at Rams Head Live that night, and it was a ---- minute walk there, and it was also very safe. We left Rams Head around -:--AM and walked back with a friend, but it was also very safe to walk back at that time of night as there were plenty of people walking about and it was well lit. We didn't have any problems with noise and slept nicely. The next morning I called down to valet for my car and it was brought to me within -- minutes. The valet worker even provided us with cold bottled water for our ride home and gave me a map with directions on how to get out of the city safely. We were very pleased with our stay. One of the best hotels we've ever stayed in. We will definitely be back when we need to stay in Baltimore!",

The music played at the bar was loud and didn't really match the atmosphere. We went back the next morning because we had breakfast vouchers. We were a party of four with only two vouchers.

			"originalText": "The hotel was very clean and nice. The maids did a great job keeping it clean. \r\nUpon arrival a lady named Jane greeted me and gave me some tourist information and to to get around town with public transportation on a map.\r\nI stayed for - days. My room was large clean , had a flat screen wall mounted Samsung tv.. Decent size. A little table , dresser closet, plenty of wall outlets for plug-in . large mirror also. bed was king size. lamps were nice , but still covered in plastic??The bathroom was nice , it had mirrors so you could see your backside, as well as watch tv in the mirror from the toilet.(lol)\r\n I usually stay fairly neat, and need little service from the maids. My biggest problem and one of the reasons they lose a star is because I placed the do not disturb sign up, and the maids still came in and cleaned. They did this - or - days in a row. If I pay for a room and place a sign up that says do not disturb, I expect them to respect it. The maid was Asian and spoke almost no English, so I assume she couldn't read the sign either. Right across the street is Brenda's soul food . There is never any wait for one person even if there is an hour wait. I brought two different friends by, and since the door locks to the elevator and she buzzes you in after she identifies you, she needs an I'd from any visitor's . This is a little bit of a hassle, and she reserves the right to refuse a guest from entrance. Although she didn't with me, she could possibly not like your guest and deny them entrance. I asked if they had hot water, an\r\nD they gave me a hot water pot and plug leith - green tea bags... Nice. There isn't any coffee , fridge, microwave or continental breakfast, but it was only --$ a night for me and with nothing else available that was decent for less than ---$ last minute it worked fine. The manger Jane was very nice, but she must live there with her dog, because every time I go in and out the hotel there she is standing out front, like she is guarding the hotel. I felt like I was renting a room from a nosy landlord kind of, she was nice and the place was too, it was just a feeling I had. There was free wifi, which was fairly quick, but it automatically bumps you off like every -- minutes and then you have to log back in all over. It was a little annoying. The bathroom also was very ready to have the floors ripped out and replaced with tile( they were linoleum.) albeit was kept clean.\r\nUpon leaving I was running late for the train back to the airport. I asked the manager Jane when I was checking out if I could take a cab to the train would be better than walking - blocks. she calls a cab she knows, and she says yea it is too close. And starts to kind of lecture me that I should have left earlier( obviously I'm know ) I'm running late and need to pay and leave, but she is lecturing me still. Finally I asked if I could pay and leave. She took my credit card and gave me a bag of ghiriadelli chocolates upon check out.\r\n I would stay again, but I will probably check others first",

We had a problem with our toilet one night and the service person arrived in less than - minutes and had it fixed immediately. \r\nThe location of this hotel is perfect. It's away from the hustle and bustle of Fisherman's wharf and the seedier Union Square. We rented a car and were glad we did as the lines for the cable cars were extremely long-being a holiday weekend. To avoid paying for parking, if you are there on a weekend and have the patience to find a spot, you can park overnight on the street if your meter isn't chargeable on weekends. Otherwise, if you park one block up at the St Mary's garage, it's about $--.-----which beats the $-- you have to pay to park at the hotel.\r\nI recommend this property to anyone who is going to San Francisco.

			"originalText": "The Argonaut is located in Fisherman's Wharf by the water. It is charming with a cool nautical theme and a great staff. The hotel is very accommodating. We booked rooms for a short two night stay but then decided to spend our second night in Napa. The hotel desk staff graciously canceled our second night without penalty. We reserved two rooms, an interior queen and a deluxe room. The queen, as expected, was very small although the decor made up for the size. The deluxe room had a 'view' but unfortunately our window looked into the scaffolding of the building across the street. When you stay there, request a higher floor (-rd or higher) facing the water. Also, the Argonaut offers a lot of 'package' deals. If you are driving a car, check out the deals that come with parking. The hotel charges $-- a night for parking (I parked on the street to save the charge and the bellman still walked over to my car and helped me with my bags. Gotta love this hotel). A rate that includes parking is often a better option than a regular room rate (the packages also include breakfast etc). Fisherman's Wharf is one big tourist trap so the area is deserted at night.. but you can get to other neighborhoods quickly. Avoid eating in the area.. food is not great and charges are high. Snag a cab or the cable car to another neighborhood and get a great meal for a lot less. During the day, its an interesting area to walk around.. and again, you can grab a cable car and visit other neighborhoods. \r\nI am a big fan of the Kimpton hotels and this ia a great one. The decor makes it a lot of fun. I'd recommend it and I'll plan to stay there again in the future.",

I had originally booked another hotel further up, but it was getting progressively worse reviews on Trip Advisor, so I decided to change to the Chancellor. On arrival I was immediately glad for the switch. It was a short walk up Powell from the BART station, so a very quick and affordable direct trip from the airport. The hotel staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. The hotel itself had a charming and welcoming atmosphere. I felt very safe and comfortable here which is important as a solo female traveller. The room was lovely, decorated tastefully, had a jar of sweets and a very comfortable bed! Brilliant location with easy access to shopping on Union Square, dining options and transport. SF is a great walking city even with all the hills and I enjoyed a big loop walk down Sutter, Market to Embarcadero and then onto Fisherman's Wharf and back the same way. Another day I took the easy way to Fisherman's Wharf via the cable car you catch on Powell. Would definitely come back to the Chancellor - excellent location, service and facilities and I felt great value for money.",

The hotel is located in the thick of cool restaurants, coffee shops, stores (including liquor stores), and limited grocery types of places. The walk to and from the Metro is pleasant with folks walking their dogs, dining at restaurants, and generally just hanging out in the area. I was approached by a presumably homeless person once, which is to be expected in any city. The hotel staff was really friendly and let me check in a little early. I reserved a King bed for myself and it was comfortable with a million pillows and nice sheets and comforter..The room was rather small and without a desk but the bathroom was huge and clean. The water pressure was very low in the shower but who really cares. The elevators are very small but have a nice classic feel as does the rest of the hotel. The lobby is small and I didn't try the restaurant but the open computer access was great.

The room, although slightly smaller than other Staybridge Suites we have stayed in, fulfilled all our needs over the - night stay, with a comfortable bed, quality bedding, and the availability of a small but very useful kitchenette. Location is excellent, with easy access to Subway and bus transport. Any doubts about the sleazier elements of the area are not a major concern. Yes, there are some, but there are far more elsewhere – even in the Times Square vicinity, and --th Street in front of the hotel is perfectly safe, if a little run down and crowded. The Port Authority Bus Station opposite is busy, but the buses arrive and depart well away from the hotel, and inside the complex are numerous fast food places, a pub, post office and a CVS outlet. Good and plentiful breakfasts are offered by the hotel, with a fitness suite located in the basement to ward off those extra pounds. All in all, the Staybridge Suites offer a fantastic package of location, comfort and value at the heart of New York. Why go anywhere else?",

			"originalText": "We stay at the Jolly Madison over the Xmas period, the main feature is it's location. You are never far from most tourist attractions from this hotel. Grand Central Station is a short walk and gets you to other places you can't get to by walking (cheaper than yellow cabs - although you should also give this a go. We booked a cab with the hotel to take us back to the airport upon our departure and we got a limo - what a way to leave New York! This was certainly better than our inward travel. Got a transfer just outside the airport and spent -- minutes driving between terminals collecting other fares before arriving back at our original terminal and heading off to our hotel.\r\nOur room was on a top floor high which was great as it meant less traffic and street noise. We had some problems with the heater in our room but the reception staff eventually resolved this by providing us with a portable heater.\r\nWe did not eat at the hotel at all because diners and deli's are available in close proximity. The best meals we found were in China Town and at Planet Holywood. If you are planning to go to Planet Hollywood negotiate a travel within the main section of the restaurant before being shown to your table otherwise you may end up like us on the top floor overlooking the action and not in it.\r\nWe took part in typical tourist activities such as Ripleys and the CSI Experience. Disappointed with both unfortunately. Had hoped to see a broadway play but we left it to late and the only available tickts were $--- each. If you ant to get to the to of the Empire State bilding would suggest going early as the queue by mid-day will take at least an hour. The boat trips around New York are great and the best way to see the Statue of Liberty, The Brooklyn Bridge etc.\r\nMake sure you book the ---- Memorial at reception. Although very emotional it gives you a true understanding of the events which took place and an appreciation for life and the spirit of New Yorkers.\r\nThe store window displays, Xmas trees and ice skating rings are just amazing over Xmas. Ice skating on Xmas Eve on Xmas day was definetely a highlight and the Hot Chocolate with marshmallows and whipped cream is wonderful. Do be careful if paying for a padlock for the lockers. I forgot where ours was and soehow managed to gain access to someone elses ;-(\r\nStumbling across Times Square one evening whilst taking a stroll was enlightening literally. All of a sudden he colour of the sky was bright. There are so many illuminated signs and this area has a real buzz at night time. Didn't care too much for the hoards of people here during the day though.\r\nWe did use the hotel bar on our last evening. The bar man was nice and friendly. The bar room was a little odd and resembled a chapel or such like.\r\nWe were surprised at just how many people there were and how many shops remained open on Xmas day. This really is the town that does not sleep.\r\nOur only regret was not having longer than - days but there is always next time.",

			"originalText": "The service was fine, but the hotel itself fell way below my expectations from such a respectable establishment as Hilton. They were nickel-and-diming me all the way. \r\n-. The carpet in the corridor is not very clean and it smelled weird there. The pool area was no better - actually, much worse. I wouldn't recommend going barefoot anywhere in that area. It's just dirty.\r\n-. The coffee maker in the room was broken - it made --- cup of coffee and then turned off. So if you want a full cup, you have to ask it - times. Of course, by then the cup is almost all cold. Good luck making tea with it, if you don't like ice tea.\r\n-. Once we have used the provided tea packs, room service didn't bother to replace them. Probably saved them a cent or so.\r\n-. There's no free internet access in the business center and no free printing. I am staying in various hotels a lot and wasn't used before to being charged dollar-a-minute for printing a simple page of driving directions. I was used to getting it for free, as it was in most hotels of this class I visited. Hilton, however, decided to save yet another ---- of a cent.\r\n-. Most hotels provide some sort of paper for the guests to write on. Hilton has post-it notes. Literally - tiny squares of paper, and that's it. If you want to write down something that's not - words - good luck, Hilton is not going to help, go find an Office Depot and buy it yourself. Here, another cent saved for Hilton. \r\n-. Parking pricing is outrageous - I've parked cheaper in San-Francisco downtown, no discounts or anything for hotel guests - but don't expect that to mean easy and convenient parking. Parking lot is crammed, and spending -- minutes looking for a random place somebody didn't notice, or trying to fit your car into the space that nobody dared to use because it's too small - is routine. All while a bunch of spaces stay empty - but general public is not allowed there, probably so that they can charge you ---% for valet parking in the same spot, in addition to the outrageous price paid for the parking - which a lot of hotels of this class provide for free. In Hilton, I not only got charged for it - I got charged twice in one of the days. They can't even make their system work properly.\r\nSummarily, the personnel of the hotel was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They did what they could. However, the hotel itself fell below the expectations - I paid more than I expected to pay for less than I expected to get from Hilton. I understand the economy is tough and everybody has to save, but saving on a couple of sheets of paper and a couple of tea bags is too much for me. When I go to a brand-name hotel like Hilton I don't expect that. After this stay I would think twice - no, a dozen times - before ever staying at a Hilton establishment again. Hope the savings were worth it.",

			"originalText": "I very much wanted to stay at a boutique hotel near Times Square in lieu of a Hilton or Marriott type. After some research, hubby and I compromised on The Paramount after seeing the price of their modern chic rooms on the website. When we checked in we were both excited about the impressive lobby. Very us. BUT we were royally disappointed when we entered our King Deluxe room. Womp womp womp...\r\nI'm normally a very flexible-laid back, go with the flow gal but this just wasn't what I was expecting at all.\r\nThe pictures seemed to be photo shopped bright and welcoming on the website. In reality, the room was entirely too small and the bathroom lacked a lot of luster. The room just seemed so dark and small. Just NOT what we had in mind for our - night NYC experience. The money spent renovating this hotel was obviously poured into the more public areas of the hotel. The closet would better be described as a compartment to store ~- jackets so our suitcases took up the little floor space we had.\r\nWe headed downstairs and explained our concerns and requested upgrade options. I inquired about their Entertainment and Couture suites displayed on their website as they are the only ones displayed. Do you know what they told me?! The available suites displayed on their website are only used for corporate events and fashion shoots. I was dumbfounded. I encouraged them to provide keys to the suite that they DO have available for purchase so that I can see it before we accept the upgrade for an additional $--- for our - nights in NYC. We saw it and it was another womp womp womp. They had simply take a wall and corned off - rooms at the end of the hallway. Even the rooms still had the heavy secure hotel door separating the bedroom from the living room AND the exit sign still existed in the cornered off wasted space in the entrance of the suite. The bedroom in the suite had a double bed. My husband and I are very tall and we by no means intend to share a double bed while paying for a suite. Desperately trying to see the positive, I looked out the window to see if our view had been upgraded. View from Times Square? It had been a bit but a partial view of lights from Times Square and the back of a billboard just wasn't worth it to me. Womp womp womp.\r\nWe headed back downstairs, handed them the suite key and stated that we will only be spending - night at The Paramount and would be checking out the following day. (Obviously, it was too late to cancel our room that night and not pay a fee, etc.) The customer service was very kind so I hadn’t the heart to share my disappointment. I'm sure it was obvious by our actions at that point.\r\nI've attached a picture of my hubby stretching out his hands so that you get an idea of just how small the King Deluxe room is. Note our luggage covering the entire opposite side of the bed. No point in showing you the view out the window, it was the back of a building.\r\nIf you care to know:\r\nNYC was insanely booked everywhere last week. We did manage to secure - nights at The Bowery (LOVED it, ---% guarantee that we will return) and the - other nights of our trip were spent at the Marriott on Times Square with an incredible view of Times Square.",

We waited another ninety minutes and checked back with the front desk and were told that they would put a rush on our room with housekeeping, that they were in the process of cleaning it, and to come back in a half an hour. We did, and the room still wasn't ready. By that time we were both exhausted and perhaps the front desk person took pity on us and upgraded us to a junior suite. \r\nThe room was quite large especially for New York hotel rooms. We had views of the street from two sides, which we enjoyed, but it was noisy. It didn't bother us, but I think it would wake up a light sleeper. The bed was comfortable and the reading lights had dimmers. The desk was large and had a power strip.\r\nWe chose this hotel over the other InterContinental in New York City because of the price, location, and previous reviewer's glowing comments. There were a few little details that just didn't compare with previous experience we've had with this hotel brand.\r\nThe furniture looked a bit shabby with scuff marks on the table and tired looking furniture, chipped paint. The bathroom had a light fixture hanging loosely from the ceiling. There was some mold on the ceiling in the shower area. There were a couple of times that I had to wait over five minutes for hot water in the bathroom and the bathroom sink had a constant drip. One of our towels had a large hole in it.

The lobby is nicely decorated in a contemporary style, but the building sure shows its age once one heads up to the guestroom floors. The woodwork outside our room was so battered looked as if someone had been hacking at it with an ax. \r\nOn the positive side, I liked the overal design of the room, and the bedding was of nice quality. But there were some serious flaws. The bathroom cabinet was cracked so severely that some of the wood veneer had copletely fallen off. And, although I asked for a nonsmoking room, the place smelled strongly of smoke. We are not smokers and didn't spend any time with smokers during our trip, but our clothes absorbed the smell from the room. When we got home and unzipped our suitcases, the smell of smoke was extremely strong. I had to dryclean the brand new overcoat that I had just purchased that very weekend at Saks.\r\nOther positives about this hotel are the location. It was very convienient to Magnificent Mile shopping and attractions. The cafe attached served great coffee, and I never waited more than a couple of minutes for my order. And, again, the staff were helpful and pleasant. \r\nOverall, the room was a good value, but the the stay would have been much more pleasant if this hotel made some basic maintenance efforts.",

			"originalText": "My first stay at a Kimpton property was on a Friday, for a business trip in DC. I booked a room at Donovan House with - criteria in mind: location, and value. The location of the hotel was convenient, as it was near the National Mall and government offices but also within - mile of several other points of interest. I based value on the overall perks-to-cost ratio. It's not scientific, but based on the feeling of, \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"did I get a good deal?\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\r\nThe first impressiom of the services was upon entering the parking garage. Valet parking is available on-location, but for the steep price of $---day. They may have mentioned that detail on the website, but I still think the Kimpton management could negotiate a better contract or reduce the overhead fee. Parking for one night added an extra --% to my overall cost. The lobby is crisp and decorated in modern style-color scheme with unique lucite bubble chairs. The decor didn't have much of an effect on my mood, since the mod furniture and walls were predominately upholstered in aubergine and burgundy shades of vinyl. I guess it just wasn't my taste, though the eye catching details could be perceived as young and fresh.\r\nUpon check-in at -:-- pm, the friendly receptionist informed me that my room was not ready due to cleaning (?!) but that I could be upgraded to a suite. Softening the blow was the fact that I had arrived just before wine hour, which, according to my research is a standard Kimpton perk. Sweet. After pushing my way past a bellhop carriage stacked with supply boxes, I waited for the elevator in the narrow corridor. On the --th floor, my spacious suite greeted me with the stale smell of cigarette smoke-as though it had formerly been a smoking room (though Kimpton properties are smoke-free as the room placard informed me, this hotel recently changed management). The area rug that overlayed the carpeting was askew. This wasnt necessarily a sign of uncleanliness but probably that nobody checked the room before my arrival. The rest of the room was exceptional: crisp Sferra linens on the bed and duvet, a clean bathroom with a large soaking tub and designer shower that were consistent with the other elements. After a quiet and comfortable night's rest, I took advantage of the complimentary coffee bar in the lobby. The brew was exceptional-was encouraged to take a second cup to-go, as well as a bottle of water. Detail-oriented hospitality was top-notch, and I have no doubt that the staff would go out of their way to assist any guest. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to enjoy the rooftop pool and bar that are features of the property. Overall rating: ----. Be sure to check AAA and government rates if you qualify.",

The person checking us in wasn't excited to see us, but the folks at the coffee shop downstairs were really nice, as was the concierge.\r\nThe room was nice - recently re-done. Very comfortable. \r\nOddly, about - floors' worth of the soda machines didn't work. We reported it to the front desk.\r\nThe parking situation was weird, since it doesn't belong to the hotel, I think. Hotel guests park on floors four through seven of the garage off to the side, but it seems to be event parking as well. We had to stalk parking spots, since it was really crowded, and some jerks in giant cars took up more than one parking spot. We could have done the valet parking, but the self-park was a great deal ($--, I think).\r\nThe workout center was in need of more ventilation (older building - window a-c units), and it is a little small, but they have what you need: cardio machines, free weights and a bench, and a multi-station weight machine. You can also purchase access to a nearby club. The sign in the workout center does suggest that before exercising, you speak with your physician and follow *his* advice. They need to update their signage, clearly.\r\nOtherwise, really nice. I will likely stay here again.",

			"originalText": "My stay at the W City Center was a Dr. Jekyll- Mr. Hyde type ordeal. For every task that they did well, there was an equal and opposite task that flopped. \r\nAs a former frequent traveler I have stayed in many different hotels ranging from - stars to - stars. And, lately, I have been having good, solid experiences booking - star hotels for my leisure trips through priceline, but my stay at the W City Center in Chicago ended that string of luck.I had read many other reviews on this website before my trip and I felt like I had enough information to know what to expect, but I was wrong.\r\nI rated my experience at the W a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"-,\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" but it was closer to a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"-.--\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" and just like in math class, I rounded down. I am not sure what the exact criteria is for star ratings, but for service, the W City Centre is a solid \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"-.-,\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" but that's as good as it gets.\r\nMy flight landed at Midway at about -:-- am, so I took the Orange line and arrived at the hotel at around --:-- am. I was expecting to check my luggage, but to my surprise I was able to check-in. And, according to them, they upgraded my bed from full to queen and gave me a courtyard view on the --th floor, so that noise from the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"L\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" wouldn't bother me. What a joke!!! \r\nMy bed wasn't even a full, it was more like a double... maybe even a twin-and-a-half. My wife and I, who sleep in a King at home, were practically on top of each other. And the courtyard view, looked more like the view from a project in Brooklyn. And, I understand that the interior rooms in the hotel have no choice but to have a view like that, but please don't tell me it's an upgrade, when it really isn't. I would have rather heard the train and had a view of the outside world, than to feel like I was in prison.\r\nThe room was tiny! After I learned was staying at the W, I looked it up and saw that the rooms were small, but the website doesn't do the room justice. There was exactly enough room to turn around, but that was about it. there was a lounge chair in the corner that was unecessary in that size room and the desk where one could use a laptop was at the foot of the bed. When you pulled the chair out to take a seat, it hit the foot of the bed, so you had to squeeze into the space between the desk and the chair. At -'-\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\", --- lbs, I'm not a huge man, but it was a feat for me to do that.\r\nThe television was in a cabinet to the left of the bed, so I had to turn my head at an awkward angle to view it. And, the question that kept running through my mind was, \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"If this is a - star hotel, where is the plasma TV?\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" I have stayed at many other - star hotels in Chicago that have had plasma for years and if I remember correctly the W Lakeshore has plasma TV's in it's rooms. \r\nI liked the fact that there was a safe in the room for my valuables, it made me feel much more comfortable about leaving certain things in the room. But, it was a too small for my laptop.\r\nThe bathroom was also very tiny, but it had a full-sized tub and a fantastic shower head. Also, the little Bliss sample products were great so I purchased full-sized versions. The toilet was extremely noisy, but I believe I figured out why. The flush was a little longer and stronger than a usual toilet, but I think it was so that all \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"debris\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" could be cleaned with one flush instead of possibly flushing more than once. I mean it's so loud, the flushing next door would wake my wife in the middle of the night.\r\nThe service at the door was great, but it came in spurts. At one point there might be three gentlemen opening the door, but at others there might not be any, only the person that hails cabs for you and if your hands are full and he's busy, then you're stuck! I didn't see a handicapped button you can push to open it automatically.\r\nThe location is decent. You're very close to the Orange and Brown line trains, two blocks from the Blue line and - or - blocks from the Red line. And, unless you're going out at midnight, like we did, there is usually a cab in the vicinity.\r\nOverall, this is not a - star hotel. You either have great service or none at all and I didn't appreciate being misled to think I was receiving some sort of benefit. I decided not to patronize the restaurant (Shikago) or bar (Whiskey Blue) because there are many other places in Chicago I'd rather spend my money. Please do your research.

Foul to the point of burying my head in the (comfy) pillows to suffocate myself. Foul to the point of leaving my clothes with a stench of, I don't know, a combination of paint, cleaning fluid and old war bandage that needs to be changed.

The room was consistently hot no matter how low I adjusted the thermostat, the bathroom was a little outdated (based on what’s advertised on your website), and the cable TV had a distorted picture even after the Engineer tried to fix it. I had an issue with my billing on my room service and had to call several times to get it resolved (never received a call from front desk, they just slid an additional bill under my door) .I’m not trying to make comparisons, but I could have stayed in the Trump Tower for a couple hundred dollars more based on what I paid to stay at the property. They have a nice property, but to advertise it as a Four Star Hotel is misleading. I would have to compare it to a Springhill Suite or Holiday Inn Express just without a Concierge. This is not an attempt to bash the property, but to merely make one aware of how their website portrays an image that lacks just a bit of what is expected.",

			"originalText": "Ok...so we decided to stay here again. After all, the location is excellent and it was one of the best priced Marriott properties in the area. We are Marriott Rewards members and always try to seek out their properties when it is time to book a vacation.\r\nThis time we decided to book a corner room because from seeing photos, they have a better layout and far better kitchen-area seating. Plus you have more windows. We ended up in one on the --th floor with a view up -th Avenue where you could see the beginning of Central Park. Plus, we had a partial view of the Chrysler Building.\r\nI'll start with what is good about this hotel. First of all, the front desk staff is very efficient, helpful and friendly. The free breakfast is quite adequate---decent food if nothing to write home about. Also, the maids who cleaned our room during the course of the week did a great job. It also appears that the bed sheets have improved---they are a much higher thread count than what was there previously.\r\nSo...how is it slipping? The furniture is starting to get shabby. The hotel is only - years old but hotel furnishings seem to take a real beating. The granite countertop on the kitchen table had some indelible stains. However, what really got to us is this --- everyday the towels and wash cloths smelled unclean and were dingy. Plus some were even ripped or looked flea-bitten. This was very off-putting. Also, the hot water tended to go out from time to time. During peak times when many are showering, it is understandable. However, when it's a time of day when most people are out, it's really inexcusable. Speaking of the plumbing---the toilet often had to be flushed twice---not good!\r\nWe never experienced these issues during our last stay two years ago. What's up with that? Is the hotel cutting corners when it comes to properly laundering the towels? Are the plumbing problems being worked on?\r\nWould we stay here again? The verdict is still out on that one. What I'm going to do is closely monitor the reviews here to see if things improve. If they have, we certainly would stay again.",

Beyond the great location, the front desk hotel staff were great. The check in was efficient, quick, and very well taken care of despite the masses of people there. We arrived at -:--, we had our car taken care of and we were in our room at -:--. The valet was pretty inexpensive ($-- for three nights of parking, though it may have been per night but I'm not sure as they only charged us $--). Further, their platinum club lounge (as the one who booked the room was a platinum club member) was superb. The food was great, the people were wonderful. Finally, their bag check was efficient, well run, and very good. \r\nOn the other hand, there were many many issues. First and foremost, our bathroom flooded. It happens. They were quick in fixing it but it's still an issue. They also forgot our towels one day, though they did deliver new ones upon being told. Their website was also very inaccurate as it advertised free wireless internet in the common areas despite there being no such service. On top of that, they lacked a book of amenities in the room and did not provide one; being hungry at - AM and wishing for room service or some sort of map, we were unable to procure one. The website was also very unhelpful, lacking hours and locations of things. Finally, it seemed that getting a card remagnitized without all four cards there would reset all cards and prevent them from working, meaning that by the end of the trip, we had only a single working card and no real means of obtaining new working ones. \r\nThe neutral in this case was the room situation. We had - people in a room, one of which did not wish to share the bed and as he was paying, one had to sleep on the floor, me. As such, while I cannot attest to the comfort of the beds, they seemed nice. The room was of adequate size as well, though it lacked a refrigerator which was not good.",

The room this time was not so nice. There were cigarette burns on the furniture and the bathroom had some issues ....but ok for the price. Dirty carpeting on the floor... \r\n-. On our exit the same man we encountered upon our arrival, informed us in again an unpleasant manner that keeping our bags for the day for our red-eye home was putting him out and not something he could easily do. In fact, more than - hours was problematic and he simply wouldn't do it despite the fact that they had a system for it in place. So - nights of staying and I couldn't store my bag for a full day until we went to the airport. \r\nHe yelled at me telling me to get out when I decided his tone and language had gone too far. I let him know I had been coming there for some time and my company uses it and I would expect if not service a kinder approach. I guess that is what we get for looking for value.... We spent our last day lugging our bags around town. But before we were sent on our way, the desk guy decided to yell at me when I suggested his services were less than par...he said I had mental problems and more. It was rather funny and horrid at once. My suggestion is don't stay here UNLESS you are willing to accept that $--- a night doesn't make you a valued customer.\r\nNeedless to say, we will not be coming back!

			"originalText": "I was there in November, and the food at the breakfast buffet was awful and overpriced. The waffles were hard as rocks, the hot food wasn't hot, there was only one type of pastry and it wasn't very good, actually stale, the fruit was tired and the pineapple was sour, the biscuits were not homemade. There was no Texas feel to the food, no Mexican type offerings or salsa. I could have been in any average hotel anywhere. The room had a balcony, but it was so windy, even propping the door open with a chair didn't work, the door kept slamming shut - so much for trying to enjoy the weather. The walking trail was pretty short and not that interesting. The rooms were nice.

The happy ending was when a few of us took it upon ourselves to get the heck out of there and check into a much safer-cleaner hotel for only a few $$$ more which was less than - min away to enjoy the remainder of the weekend. Where do I start about this poor excuse for a hotel? No towels-not enough wash cloths (I had to dry off with a pillow case), smelly rooms, dirty linen & tub, clogged tub, wet carpet, unkept trashy overgrown grounds, holes in exterior doors to rooms, spider webs galore, wobbly boards on steps-porches leading to rooms, insects, wet stains on bed, pair of panties w-a pad left on floor beside bed, inadequate kitchen items, raccoon eating from garbage area, alley cats roaming, drug deals in parking lot, inadequate lighting, manager never returned calls re: numerous complaints, unprofessionally dressed night auditor, rusty shuttlebus, bad-looking surroundings. I was very concerned for all the family members who stayed at this place. I'm not one who typically takes the time to write hotel reviews, but this experience was terrible enough that I felt compelled to do so. The owners-managers of this place need to just face the music and do whatever needs to be done to renovate, update, clean out-clean up, or just shut it down. No Joke, this hotel is not a safe place to stay. Wyndam, this place may eventually ruin your great reputation!!!!",

The evening reception is a nice touch if you are ok with nachos and draft beer (not that there's anything wrong with that).

A two inch deep sink does one thing... it splashes water, most of it on you. As for the shower it has a recessed shower head in the ceiling, I am - --\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" and can adjust it my friend is - -\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" and she had to get on her tip toes ,someone who is - -\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" or shorter better bring there tooth brush into the shower and poke at it if they want to adjust it. It is also in front of the of the shower handles and the shower door does not slide. This means you have to turn the water on standing under it for a nice blast of cold water until you can dive out of the way or until it's warm enough to get back under. \r\nSome other things might help this hotel get the - or - rating the would like and that is don't let the city or whoever position a giant dumpster in front of your hotel. Not only is it a eye sore it's very loud when items are thrown into it. There are a lot of places on that street that are not occupied ---- and how about a mini bar?? I know when I booked the room it didn't have one and it didn't bother me from my computor... It did bother me when I wanted a drink when I got to my room.\r\nOverall the rooms were very clean, the staff very nice and the location is great, some small changes and the hotel would be great also.

			"originalText": "We have stayed in the Charlotte area a number of times but never before at the Marriott City Center. The location suited our needs perfectly for this particular trip.\r\n The check-in and bellman staff was exceptionally courteous and quite efficient. The lobby was attractive and well-maintained. Self-parking in the garage is not difficult once you navigate the very sharp and narrow curve in the entrance ramp. It felt reasonably safe and well lit. Our room was a bit small but certainly clean and comfortable and very reasonably priced given our discount (AAA, AARP, and Marriott- sponsored packages all work out to pretty much the same weekend discount). \r\nBUT, and here is why I only rate our stay neutral and consider even that somewhat generous:\r\nWe were there on Friday and Saturday nights. Friday night we were awakened by extremely loud voices and laughter in the hallway right outside our room on an upper floor. I peeked out the security peephole and saw a group of well-dressed young people. they were calling to each other from doorway to doorway, down the hall, and generally behaving as though they were in a college dorm on a weekend night. I assume we were the unfortunate hallmates of people who had attended a very successful rehearsal dinner or other youth-oriented event where a lot of alcohol had been consumed and the reality of being in a grownup setting had been forgotten. I called the desk to complain and after five minutes the noise subsided somewhat, whether because the celebrants realized their behavior was unacceptable or because someone came up from the desk to tell them to be quiet I do not know.\r\nSaturday night was much worse and something the hotel should have controlled. The relatively unobtrusive thumping music we had heard and ignored in the background Friday night had become a major annoyance, blasting up to our high-floor room for hours. We tried to go to sleep about --:--; it continued until after - a.m. Several times between - a.m. and - a.m. I called the desk and was told various things, among them that there had once been a club nearby that caused noise problems and the problem had just reappeared.... they were sending someone across the street to complain to the club...not clear if they were calling police, Not quite clear how many other people if any had called to complain this particular night, It was as loud as if we were on the street right outside the club--but keep in mind that not only were we on a high floor, we had our windows closed, and the air conditioning was on. \r\nI suppose that on a week night for business travelers the Marriott Ceity Center is still a viable option, but I don't know the club habits of Charlotte--perhaps even on a week night there might be an issue. Unless I were to be told with certainty that the club noise was no longer an issue I would not stay at this Marriott again despite its excellent location. I am also disappointed that although my husband included a comment about the excessive noise and poor response from staff in his response to the standard \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"how was your visit\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" survey he received upon our return home, we have received no reply or acknowledgment of any kind--nearly a month after the survey was returned.",

But we had to move some furniture (my little one tends to fall from the bed so we always need to create some barriers around his side of the bed) and we noticed that behind furniture the vacuum cleaner had not been used in quite a while. Daily cleaning was done, but from time to time you have to dust behind the beds too!! That took some points off. Also rooms start being worn out a bit, although this is not a big issue in my opinion.\r\nPremises: very nice.

After booking I started reading the reviews and was very nervous about my choice, but there was nothing to do because the deposit was non-refundable. I needn't have worried; our stay was absolutely fine. Yes, there is truth to the bad reviews -- the rooms are small, the bathroom tile is somewhat dingy (though clean), the air conditioning wasn't impeccable.. but it was adorable and comfortable and clean and quiet and fantastically located and completely suitable for our weekend. The bed and pillows were comfortable, the shower was excellent, and all the staff we dealt with were extremely friendly. \r\nSo really, this hotel is all about your expectations. Those who expected a --star completely modern room would inevitably be disappointed, but for us, who expected a small but functional room in a beautiful old hotel for an excellent city price, this was a great choice. I never write reviews but just wanted to comfort anyone who might be as terrified by the awful reviews here as I was!",

Happened to stay at the Hyatt Regency Riverwalk on the same trip and I would choose that Hyatt over this one hands down. If I hadn't compared the two Hyatts back to back, perhaps I would have looked on the Grand more favorably. \r\nService at the Grand Hyatt was friendly, provided the staff weren't overwhelmed by crowds. They did automatically offer and accommodate a late checkout, a positive that seems to have become a trend with the chain for loyalty club members. The lobby was generally very busy and loud but not laid out or furnished in a manner to encourage people-watching. The hotel location is great if attending a convention and still pretty good for any other downtown or riverwalk activities with a few blocks of walking. The staff of the main restaurant were too flustered to acknowledge my presence at the time I tried to visit so I gave up and thus can't review the food. \r\nMy room on the --th floor had a nice view but the furniture was a bit worn and about average for a business hotel and below average for a Hyatt though the style fit the Hyatt brand. All I could get was two double beds and no upgrade for loyalty status. One mattress sagged significantly but the two doubles proved helpful when I switched to the other bed for dramatically improved comfort. \r\nIn the end, the Grand paled in comparison to the other Hyatt downtown, other Hyatts I've stayed at and other competitors in town despite a price tag that seems to be higher. There was no reason to flee this hotel but I didn't find much to draw me back to this location either.",

The location is right next to the Wooley Park metro station. The room was recently renovated, and upon first glance the hotel room looked very clean. However upon further inspection, I noticed stray hairs in the bathtub and under the sink. I was disappointed when I opened a cabinet door that looked like it would contain a refrigerator and there was just a giant cabinet. The room did have a -- inch flat screen TV…definitely not HD. Although, the Marriott website advertises that all rooms have HBO, this channel did not come through on our TV. \r\nMy biggest surprise was how many families were staying at the hotel (maybe due to the proximity to the zoo). I would highly recommend that the Marriott put families and business travelers on different floors, as families tend to be noisier and be awake at different hours than business travelers. A screaming child in the hallway disturbed our slumber at a ridiculously early hour two days in a row. \r\nAt then end of the trip, I would say there was nothing to big to complain about and nothing so great to write home about.",

The room itself was clean and tidy however as the room was located near the junction of two roads and two sets of traffic lights the lack of soundproofing was apparent when we entered the room, we believed however that the traffic noise may ease as the evening drew on - WRONG...My family and I were not able to get any sleep due to the constant road noise which rather than getting better later as we had anticipated just got worse - we could hear car radios as they sat at the junction amongst other general traffic noise and road cleaning etc. Quite clearly the soundproofing to the room is inadequate and not the sort of night anyone who has travelled the distance we had wants on their first night in the US.\r\nThe next morning my husband complained about the noise and the receptionist said she could move us to another room. We moved to the other room in the morning and then went out as we had travel plans for that day. Upon returning to the room we could hear noise once again - can you believe it we had been put over what I can only imagine was the air conditioning generator or similar, there was a constant noise all night long....how glad were we that we did not have to spend another night here.\r\nWhilst the hotel was clean and tidy and the rooms were adequate we felt very upset that we had been treated so badly. After complaining about the noise on the first night we thought that the staff would have tried at least to give us a room with no noise or even an upgrade but no they did the complete opposite and put us back in the same position.\r\nI would not recommend this hotel for the above reasons and whilst the location to Fishermans Wharf is handy a good nights sleep is more preferable I am sure to anyone. I would love to hear the managements comments as to why they thought it was acceptable to treat us this way. Do not book if you want sleep!",

After a long a trip from central california up to the bay area, I went up to the front desk and wanted into to check into my room. As I arrived to the front desk, a hotel associated asked me some questions. She asked me for my credit card on file. I currently have a mastercard debit card that used to book the room. She then, swiped the card, and asked me, \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"how much do you have on here?\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" I told her, less than -- dollars. I wasn't sure why she was asking me this. So now, all of the sudden she tells me that the hotel charges --- dollars a NIGHT for any incidental fees. (I booked the room for two nights) I was completely blow away with that statement. I had already booked the room WELL IN ADVANCE (Back in MARCH in be precise) and i didn't have any spending extra spending money on my card.\r\nI told the hotel associate that \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" I was completely unaware of that, I thought that booking in advance was enough\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" She then NEGOTIATE some sort of \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"plea bargain\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\". She stated that because I had booked the room in advance, she would only charge me --- dollars and not --- dollars for the incidental fees.\r\nTold her \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" Let me make some phone calls, and i'll come back up to the front desk.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" The hotel associate insisted that one of the other associates hold my bags for me. So I gave her my bags.\r\nAfter making some phone calls, I went back up to the front desk, and the associate that previously helped went on \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"break\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\". I was persistent that I needed to speak with her again. One of the lobby attendants went outside to locate her. He came back and told me \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" the next associate will be happy to help you. \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\r\nSo I went up to the desk again, and explained my situation. as I was explaining this; the new associate looked at me will a puzzled look. She then stated \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" the incidental fee, is a one time set fee of --- dollars. you don't pay that fee per night, that you stay here\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" so then she swiped my card, and she gave me my room key. I was so happy that I had finally got my room key, for a room that I had paid for well in ADVANCE. My friend was even calling around for other hotels just to see if anything was available; and being that it was PRIDE weekend, no other room were available.\r\nYou may think this is the end of my story but it's not.\r\nI was so tired and exhausted for STRESSING about my getting room, that I had forgotten to retrieve my bags. So I went back to the front and asked for my bags. *SIGH* A lobby attendance approached me, and I told him \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" oh I need to get my bags\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" He then asked \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" do you have a baggage claim ticket.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" I told him \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"no, the hotel front desk insisted apon taking our bags. when i went to make that phone call that is when they took them.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\r\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"oh, so you need to speak to a manager\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" He stated.\r\nAfter a few minutes he walked out with my bags. FINALLY. and then he asked \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"would you like me to take them to your room?\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" I told him \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"sure\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" I was fed up with the hotel and staff by now.\r\nSo he brought the bags up to my room, and that was it.\r\nDue to the these experiences I don't suggest you stay this hotel.

The next day, no one called me about switching my room. When I called the front desk, I was told that they had no note from the manager about switching my room. However, after discussions, they said they found me another room with a king size bed. They brought me the keys to the other room. I vacated my existing room, left the keys to the existing room inside that room and went to the new room. Unlocked the door to the new room, only to find that it was still occupied!!!!! So, I had to call to get my original room back. What a disaster! No one offered me a discount, a free cocktail, or anything for my trouble (and their repeated screw ups).

The receptionist provided us with our room key. My boyfriend requested a quite room as we knew times square would be fairly noisy. We were placed on the -th floor in what is described as a spacious queen room. \r\nThe lift is small and very slow, we arrived on a dark floor with marks on the walls where the wallpaper had been knocked from luggage. My initial thoughts were that the hotel looked tired from the minute the lift doors opened! \r\nWe opened the door for our room and immediatley see the bed, the room was tiny and no way near spacious...the room had a mild smell of smoke not fresh as if it had been smoked in before...the skirting boards were chipped and marked...wallpaper marks...and the black valance sheet that surrounds the bed was ripped and covered in marks...the bathroom door and front door had fingerprint marks on...I knew straight away I could not sleep in the room so we requested another room...we placed in room --- on the second floor this room was better but still not what I would call - star....we struggled to sleep due to the outdoor noise of times square and the main road...emptying of rubbish...sirens...I would rather sleep in a room with noise than the first room we was in.\r\nThe following morning after only a few hours sleep we woke up, got ready and packed our bags. I spoke with a very rude receptionist who had no sympathy and did want to hear any feedback her response was 'all hotels in NYC are of this standard' I requested to speak with the manager...we spoke with the manager and she was very apologetic she understood and sympathised with our situation. She told us to enjoy our day whilst she investigated with housekeeping and advised us that our bags will be moved to thew new room when we return.\r\nWe returned feeling apprehensive about the next room..we were placed on the -th floor in room --- the room was what we were originally hoping for, although we were upgraded to a king room, nice large comfortbale bed, bigger room with more space and quiet .The hotel manager left a lovely apology note with fresh fruit and still water. This was very kind.However, there were still some problems they place a throw on the end of the bed, in all rooms they were stained and either need replacing or washed, the bedding consists of a sheet with a duvet and another sheet, every night I would do my best to not let the duvet near me just the new sheets as I assumed the duvets were not washed!\r\nThe lifts are very frustrating, slow and small, your better off taking the stairs unless you have luggage!\r\nWe will not be returning to the hotel, the third room was much better and comfortable and I am sure if we were put int there in the beginning our experience would have been very dfferent.",

			"originalText": "My overall experience at this hotel was average to above average. What really brought my opionion down regarding this hotel was being given a smoking room when my reservation confirmation stated I would have a non-smoking room. Granted, some of the fault is mine because I could have called the front desk and requested another room. However, it was late at night, my family was tired (my - and - year old daughters were already asleep), and we just wanted to get to bed. In any event, it shouldn't take a phone call from me to change our room. We should have been issued a non-smoking room in the first place since it was stated on our reservation confirmation. We didn't plan on spending a good deal of time in the room anyway. Lastly, I used my Marriott rewards points to secure the --night stay (normal charge is apparently ~$----night) so maybe we were low on their priority list. The smell was very distinctive when you first walked into the room. Other than the smell, the stay was nice!!! The hot breakfast was wonderful. The hostess was very friendly. She gave our kids coloring books and crayons to keep them busy during our breakfast. She also gave me directions to the train station to go to Wrigley Field. Her advice to take the train instead of the bus saved us a little bit of time. They offered multiple newspapers (Herald, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, etc). The hotel has easy access to Lake Shore Drive and provides an excellent opporunity to run-jog along the lake. You're about - blocks from Michigan Ave which has some of the world's best shopping and restaurants. We ate at the Cheesecake Factory (- minute walk) and the Food for Life \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"foodcourt.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" Easy access to public transportation. \r\nOverall, a nice stay.

The hotel staff were no help - they continued to transfer me to the same TMobile number.

			"originalText": "My wife and I booked a cruise with my side of the family and decided to spend one night in San Pedro before we embarked on the ship. We booked our own room and the other three members of my family got the room next door which was adjoined. So far so good. We were told to talk to the bell desk to arrange for transport in the morning to the cruise ship, but no one was there. After waiting by the bell desk for -- minutes, we decided to just go upstairs and come back later. \r\nAs we walked through the hotel to get to our room, we noticed the hallway doors were propped open by rag towels stuffed under the doors. EVERY single hallway door was propped up as such. Upon arrival at our room on the third floor (we stayed in room --- and my family in ---, we saw that the rooms had probably not been renovated since the ----s or early --s. The bathroom floor tile had a sticky film or oil that you could feel with even your shoes and the air conditioner was creaking and rusted. One of our bath towels had a yellow- brown stain on it that was visible while hanging. The air conditioner was actually only blowing regular air and wasn't working properly at all. We opened the window since it was cool outside, but the window opened only --- inches. We decided to go back downstairs and not worry about it since we were tired and checked in late as it was. \r\nWe ate dinner at the restaurant with so-so food that was way overpriced, and for a party of -, an --% gratuity was added. I don't know if this is customary, but we didn't think a $--- dinner bill for - people with no alcoholic drinks ordered was a great deal.\r\nWe went back to the bell desk, and again, no one was present to make arrangements for us. We waited another -- minutes, and finally a bell person came. We went back upstairs and my wife fell quickly asleep. The window was still open, and starting at about --:--pm, a loud crashing was heard outside. I went to look and saw that our room view was of the alley- garbage disposal area of the hotel. It also seemed to be a sort of loading- dock area. Every ----- minutes, another crashing noise came which made it impossible to sleep. I had no choice but to close the window and turn on the broken air conditioner. The air conditioner blew air, but the air felt humid and extremely uncomfortable. I could have complained and gotten another room but my wife and family were asleep and exhausted so I chose to endure the horrible experience for the night. In total, I think I finally fell asleep around -am and slept for -.- or - hours. \r\nDisgruntled in the morning, I still washedup up in the nasty bathroom and used hand towels to dry myself off since my wife used the only non-stained bath towel we had. We went down to breakfast and had a decent breakfast buffet (free since we are Hitlon Gold Members). After packing up and coming downstairs for our --:-- transport, I thought the worst was over. I made my complaints about the above to the front desk to just \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"let her know\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" and the lady just seemed to take some notes and said thanks for letting us know. At that point, I didn't really care anymore since I just wanted to be off on a good cruise and have no more worries about the crappy hotel experience.\r\nWe get into the transport vehicle, and my wife and I get into the back seat, and what did the driver have playing on the stereo? Unedited rap music with explicit sexual lyrics including all types of profanity that could send you down to he final level of hell. Once all passengers were loaded into the vehicle, the driver did NOT turn off the music or change the station! \r\nThis is the absolute WORST hotel experience I have ever had. I will NEVER stay at it again even if it were free, and I will make sure none of my friends or family ever have to go through what I went through again.",

When I called the front desk and asked for a replacement they told me they did not have any spare dryers. They also didn't provide conditioner for your hair. I found several tears in my comforter. Overall, the whole place just needs improved lighting. It's dim, including the lobby, and it makes the whole place seem depressed. Honestly I didn't feel completely safe there. I'm sure I was, but the dim and drab atmosphere really gave me the creeps. I spent the two nights I was there really wishing my husband had been with me. \r\nOverall, this is not a good place to stay. It's cheap, but you really get what you pay for. It's not a bargain.

I was worried about noise, but they weren't noisy. However, I strongly suspect this used to be a different kind of hotel - it just didn't have that La Quinta feel at ALL. It's easily the worst La Quinta I've ever stayed in.\r\nOur air conditioner struggled to cool the room (and it wasn't even full-on Florida heat outside) and we woke up to the feeling of dew everywhere in the morning. A major purpose of AC in Florida is to pull the moisture out of the air. The front grill of the AC kept falling open, too.\r\nThere was a mysterious small hole in the light switch in the toilet-bath room, which lined up with the front of the shower. There have been enough incidents in hotels and other businesses of hidden cameras that I found this worrisome - no problem, I took the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Give us a --!\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" sticker off the toilet paper and covered it up (btw, they are trying VERY HARD to get your '--'...) The smoke detector in the room was in an odd location, as well. Paranoid? Probably.\r\nWhile I'm still thinking about the bathroom - this is one of those bathrooms that require you to do a dance to get the door closed - and in fact, the door brushes up against the toilet on open-shut. I doubt this is accessible. Showerhead was too short for me, and I'm only -'-\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\". Faucet aerator was broken.\r\nBreakfast was a major disappointment. In my past travels, I've always associated LQ with a good breakfast. They had 'decided not to' put the waffles, fruit, etc. out - there was some Otis Spunkmeyer muffins and some plain bagels, coffee, some juice (most out) and two kinds of cereal. They started putting things away before - am. Nowhere were the breakfast times posted. The room completely lacked one of those guidebooks with the hotel map, policies, etc.",

Having read the reviews from \r\nTrip Advisor.com, and knowing that this was not the Embassy Suites, we \r\nwere prepared for the worst, which is exactly what we got! The \r\nneighborhood surrounding the hotel is one of the worst in San \r\nFrancisco, which includes pan handlers, transients, prostitutes and \r\ndrug dealing. \r\n Upon arrival we were greeted at the counter and given an actual key (as opposed to the what seems to be the standard, in today's technology, a key card) We then boarded an ancient elevator, which had a door that needed to be opened from the outside with a door handle. The elevator held only four people at a time and would not operate unless the entry door was closed. (At one point we waited approx -- minutes for the elevator on the fourth floor, due to the fact that the entry door hadn't been closed on the ground floor.) \r\n Our walk to our room was met with trash left in the hallway (which was still there the next day) by other guests. Most of the other guests seemed to be students of the Culinary Academy located across the street from the hotel. \r\n Upon entry into our room, we discovered several black mold spots on the bathroom walls, poor patch jobs to the bathroom tile, a picture which was hung upside down and very few amenities. \r\n After spending the night listening to the neighborhood locals scream and yell, hearing the numerous sirens go past the hotel, waking to the sound of the guest in the room next door throwing up, accompanied with the odor of vomit, we decided to check out, even though we still had another free night stay left. \r\n The only bright spots were that it was an architecturally interesting building, which was built in the ----'s, although it needed serious remodeling and the Temple bar and grill had pretty good food.",

But it was more of a let-down. There is nothing romantic, friendly, warm, or exciting about it, but the name. So the location is great. no doubt about it. The staff (except for one lady whose role was hard to define - but she seemed like an \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"angel in the lobby - mrs fix-it-all\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" - she was brilliant) was very! ordinary. That started with a very rigid and partially even rude process of getting our reservation done. the check-in was more like standing in line at the post office - is this really - stars?? the level of friendliness is minimal and the doorman rudely ask for tip. Now, we travel between ---- times on leisure per year, and tipping in different countries is no stranger to us. Yet, asking for is so bluntly, whilst he didn't even hail down the cab for us (we had to do that ourselves) is just not what you'd expect of \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"The Waldorf\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" - in the end, I have to say, it's just another very ordinary Hilton hotel - not worth the money they take of you. The A-C in the room is hard to manage and totally outdated, the rooms are big & spacious - that was nice. Breakfast in the Lobby Restaurant was very ordinary and service was slow. The hostess seems to float on a cloud of Ego....not sure she understands service quality and that the guest actually pays her salary. The -nd breakfast option was literally laughable....it's a cheap-charly buffet version that you'd expect in a --star hotel; Compared to other --star hotel breakfasts, this was a disappointment and we opted to not eat in the hotel at all for the rest of our stay. The bar is fairly nice & barmen seem to know what they are doing. The best part however was the super-cheap approach by \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Ms sales woman\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" as my husband was waiting for me. Her smile didn't stop as she tried to sell!!! right after our arrival, some Hilton Card. - You'd expect that on a bazar in Morroco, but certainly not in the lobby of a --star hotel. Very cheap approach. The washrooms in the public areas are guarded by staff which is super unfriendly and rude. Obviously the hotel is used --% as a tourist attraction and there is no security or anyone that would allow the guest a bit of privacy. It's an \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"all walk in, walk around, hang around in the lobby\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" feeling. - A smaller hotel gives you more the feeling of a welcome guest, than this corporate institution. Hindsight - it'd been worthwhile paying a bit more on the anyways exorbitant price and stay at the Plaza.

Told me they could not replace the lamp till the next day((aka I am out of luck, so sorry) Then when they came a -rd light went out while they were there, again they replaced it. So basically they do not check their rooms at all before giving out keys. Then I had a Traders Joe's bag full of paper goods , food and above all religious items. It was under the desk. We called at -:-- to have the room cleaned . We left and came back the bag was gone. We called down and told they would look for it. They did not find it. (big surprise there) Then my friend was told the maid said she did not take anything(so calling us liers ) If I were to lie, I say my laptop was stolen. I do not think she stole it , she was just careless and tossed it like trash(I have had the same bag in numerous hotels) Anyhow my friend was said there sorry next time your here we will upgrade you and have a nice day.

			"originalText": "After staying there I now agree with other reviewers that this is a good hotel if you are only going to be in town for a few days I was there for a week and that was too long. I purchased a club level room, which is on the --st or --nd floor of the tower buliding and you get a lot of perks with that as well. \r\nWhen I arrived I had to wait over - hours for my room becuase the person that was staying in my assigned room had not bothered to check out yet. They offered me a room on a lower level but I would still get the club benefits but I decided to wait for the room I paid for not some lower level replacement. The staff also told me that a different club level room was available and that it would be -- minutes so that the staff could clean it so I took this option. An hour later I approached the desk for the third time and was given room keys and sent on my way. \r\nThe club room on the --nd floor is nice but is not all that exciting to be honest, it has great views and has complimentary snacks and drinks as well as breakfast and dinner snacks but not enough nor quality enough to warrant what I paid to stay there.\r\nAbout the thrid day into my vacation I decided to go and see what the breakfast in the club room had and arrived in time to see dirty plates everywhere and to find out that I was too late. After inquiring more information from the staff member that was up there I learned that upon check in I should have been given a welcome letter explaing all of this and vouchers for the restaraunt in the lobby as well. I went down to the front desk and explained my grief about not being informed. I was then given the welcome letter and some vouchers I was technically owed so all in all they did not really give me anything extra. Also I leanred from the club room staff memeber that the room would be closed for the next week which I was NOT AT ALL INFORMED ABOUT! This was truly upsetting. \r\nSo for my trip that I paid for I got:\r\naverage staff members\r\nbelow acceptable customer service\r\nthe rooms were good only becuase of the view (the rooms also had extremely firm mattresses that I was unable to sleep on and NO FRIDGE) I had to go and buy a cooler so my leftovers would not go to waste!!!\r\nOverall I spent too much money on services and options that I did not get to use and did not get any kind of compensation for my extra expenses. \r\nThe hotel overall is nice but they have a long way to go before I will ever conider staying there again!!!",

This looks like a pretty new Westin and in my opinion looks like the nicest hotel in downtown Memphis - not counting the historic Peabody of course. \r\nOne thing that drives me crazy is how much you have to park at hotels. They charge $-- - day to park in their garage. I used points, but this isn't a cheap hotel, and it seems like the more you spend for a room at some places, the more they keep getting you everywhere else! \r\nI also am disappointed that they charge so much for breakfast. I never can understand that you can spend $-- at a Holiday Inn Express - Hampton Inn, but you still get a free breakfast. When you stay at a hotel like this- you pay $--- - night and then they want you to pay $-- for a breakfast the next morning.\r\nThe room we had was really nice. No complaints. Very spacious, with a comfortable bed, big bathroom, nice amenities and cool view overlooking the FedEx Forum and Gibson Guitar Factory. Great location -- Beale Street is just around the corner. Great place if you plan on spending a lot of time in downtown Memphis - within walking distance. \r\nA couple service issues - concierge was not very knowledgable in terms of restaurant recommendations. Also, I went down there to ask for some more coffee for our room, since all they had was decaf, and there was no one at the front desk for about -- minutes. I found this mind boggling. Literally no one anywhere. There was also an elevator out which made the wait for the other one pretty long. \r\nOther than that, it's still a really nice hotel, the people were friendly and it's a good location for downtown Memphis.",

Luckily I had put their number in my cell phone before we left home because our luggage pick up got moved to terminal - to one of the baggage claim areas where we had to walk about - minutes outside to get there. Upon arriving there I didn't see the courtesy phones that the hotel told me to use to call them. The hotel itself was very basic, about what you would expect from a Super -. The room was very basic, but clean and looked as if it had been recently painted. We were so tired we didn't hear any planes, but we also got up early to get started on our vacation. The breakfast was very skimpy, a few cereals and breads and pastries. No fresh fruit or yogurt , but what really bothered me was the pitcher they kept refilling with milk looked like it had not been cleaned in weeks and the lady working at the desk was not at all friendly. The plus side of this budget motel is the fact that it is right across the street from Avis Car Rental and a few blocks from Budget, which happens to be across the street from the Marriott Renaissance. We had rented from Budget and so after breakfast we just walked ( about - minutes) to the Budget lot, rented our car and drove back to the Super - and check out and were on our way! I did ask if their shuttle could drop us off at the Budget lot on it's way to the airport and was told \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"No\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" in no uncertain terms!",

			"originalText": "What a beautiful hotel and AWSOME location. Right in the middle of down town San Francisco. Located on Market street, a main road through downtown, this hotel is a very old hotel but has wonderful charm. \r\nREMEMBER THAT THIS IS PART OF THE LUXURY COLLECTION HOTELS!!\r\nValet parking is VERY expensive, $-- +tax a day with in and out privledges but we never needed our car. There is NO self parking. The valet guys and the doormen were more that willing to help you with any directions that you need.\r\nThe \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"F\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" cable car will take you down to Fisherman's Warf. To pick up the car you cross Market Street to the depot. Cost is $-.-- a person and the ticket you get is usually good for - or so hours so be sure to hold onto it. The only problem with this mode of transportation is that once you get down to the Warf it is really difficult to get back. We waited over -- minutes for a car to come and finally decided to walk back. It's about a - hour walk but very, very enjoyable, just be sure to get a map form the hotel before you venture out. \r\nThere are alot of bums in the area which was a little wierd but I guess that you get that is a big city. They really weren't a problem.\r\nThere is a lot just in the hotel area to keep you busy. The genuine cable cars run in the area which was really fun to see. Union Square is a must. Like I said before, be sure to get a street map at the hotel it will REALLY help people that have never been to the area before. \r\nNow to the hotel itself. Very nice but.........the sheets are AWFUL!! They felt like paper and the bed was old and VERY uncomfortable. When you are staying in a -+ star hotel and may be paying alot of money then why can't EVERYTHING be top of the line?? We are Starwood Gold members and so we were hoping for some sort of an upgrade. When we checked in we went to the preferred check in area and were told that we were given a superior king room. Cool right??? Well, wrong. When we entered the room it was a little small, understandable as to the location of this hotel and space is at a premium in the city. The room and bathroom were nice but cramped. When we looked out the window all that we could see was a part of the hotel. Brick wall with windows of other rooms. We thought if this is what gold and a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"superior\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" room (To get gold status you have to either spend $--,--- or spend -- nights in any SPG property in a years time. Not that easy.) then we wonder what a normal not updated room was like. Don't get me wrong, the room was nice, it had its small problems but it was still nice. \r\nRoom service which we didn't use seemed VERY expensive by looking at the menu. We visited the bar, Maxfield's to have a couple of drinks. We sat at the bar and waited several minutes to get waited on. We finally ordered and they also gave us a bowl of \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"snack\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" type chips. As we were sitting there enjoying ourselves we noticed that when people left they took the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"snack\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" bowls and emptied part of the chips leaving some in and then refilled them....without washing them!!!! OMG!!! We talked to a rude manager and he said that he would take care of it. So BEWARE of Maxfield's and the drinks were VERY expensive around $---- for liquor and $--- a beer. That was the only experience we had with dining. We did notice that the buffet in the morning was around $----- a person. We went to the Starbucks and the McDonalds down the street instead. There is also a Del Taco, Subway, Westfield shopping center and several other stores and restaurants in the area. Also if you are down at the Warf go to Chippino restaurant and eat. VERY GOOD!! \r\nJust remember that you are smack dab in downtown and this is a great location. Just beware that if you are spending a lot of money that it's not always what you think it is. You also have to remember that you basically need to add $-- a day +TAX to the room for parking. We don't think that we would stay here again as I'm sure that there are other hotels in the area that may be just as good if not better that we would investigate first.

			"originalText": "My husband and I stayed at the Palmer House for seven nights during the Thanksgiving holiday. Let me point out that Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House - a New York outfit bought it a couple of years ago. They're undergoing a huge $--- million renovation and the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Chicago\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" charm is being killed off in favor of \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"New York-New York!!\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" No offense, but if I want to go to New York City, I'll go. \r\nI have stayed at the Palmer House dozens of times in the last -- years. The last time prior to this visit was in ----. We decided to give the Palmer House one more try. While the ---- visit certainly lacked lustre, this visit was awful! I remember the graciousness of the hotel. Seeing all the staff happy and better yet, happy to see you! Now - we got the distinct impression we were a bother. The bellmen (and I use the term loosely) look at you when you walk it like you're cramping their style. We saw older guests lugging their cases up the steps, while the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"bellmen\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" yacked on with eachother!! In the entire week we were there, no one opened the door for us - no one greeted us. Shame on these new owners. Don't they know the first thing about customer service? First impressions? Evidently not.\r\nThe first room they gave us had a terrible stagnant water smell coming from the bathroom drains. It was horrible and kept us up at night. Furthermore, the carpet had not been vacuumed and the bathroom floor and mirrors were not clean. We had to call housekeeping three times. Each time they would come, they didn't correct the problems! We gave up. We tried to change rooms but were told the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"We're completely sold out...\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" line. We made our reservations for this trip in July!! We're Hilton Honors members - who cares! Anyway, the next day, we changed rooms and while the room was better, we still experienced problems with water, for instance, on two mornings, the water ran brown with silt! Not good.\r\nThe restaurant \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Lockwood\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" did not open until Thanksgiving Day, despite being advertised as opening weeks before. We made reservations there for dinner several weeks prior. I must say, the retaurant is terrible!! The whole layout stinks! The ceilings are far too low, the tables are bare, no table cloths, no flowers, no candles. Stark. The flow of the restaurant is tangled at best. No one knows which way to go while making their way to the buffet, which is situated at the far end of the long and narrow restaurant. It's a zig-zig game getting to and from. Not only that, but we ate there for breakfast each morning (simply because our rate included it) and the congestion at the buffet and lack of service was miserable. There are plenty of waiters hanging about, but I don't think the manager has told them what to do yet!! No salt and pepper shakers and silverware one morning. No coffee the next morning. Funny enough, we spoke to the manager of the restaurant and he admitted to us that the restauarnt had been designed by people who had no restaurant planning experience!! No kidding. I'd avoid this place. To think the hotel closed the wonderful French Quarter Restaurant and opened this??!! Unforgivable!! One more thing about this restaurant. The weird music choice. Who wants to hear Janice Joplin while eating Thanksgiving Dinner - or any other time for that matter!! The music was awful. Rap, New Age, Rock, ect. The manager said they were playing the staff's CD's. Wwhhhhaaat??? \r\nFor a good restaurant, try Petterino's, The South Water Kitchen (WONDERFUL!!) and Harry Caray's. There's also a Corner Bakery that serves good coffee, sandwiches and pastries.\r\nLastly, the decor is no longer tasteful. The lobby looks awful with a bar sticking out in the middle and massive yellow chairs obstructing the once lovely view. There are people guzzling drinks and half eaten plates of food cluttering up tables - in the lobby!! Dreadful. No relaxation there at all anymore. You cannot even walk through it. It's a circus. The carpet choice on the floors we were on -- and then -- is hideous! I describe at as the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"stone-out peacock of pinball wizardry\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\". I have a feeling Potter Palmer would flip if he saw this mess!\r\nWhat are these new owners thinking??? A staff member told us the new owners also bought the old Carson Pirie Scott building directly across the street, which closed in February. I shutter to think.....\r\nWell, with Marshall Field's selling out to Macy's, Carson's closed the Berghoff Restaurant closed, Trader Vic's closed and now the Palmer House in complete shambles...... Chicago is sinking fast. We sure hate to see it go..... What's next, are they going to raze Wrigley Field now? They seem to be the last man standing. Good-bye Chicago.\r\nWe did decide on one thing. No more Hilton Hotels for us. Even though Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House, their name is still attached. We're sticking with Marriott, who is fabulous. (We made the switch after our Palmer House trip three years ago)\r\nThere are plenty of hotel choices in Chicago. We stayed at the Marriott Renaissance last year and it was great. If we ever get up the nerve to come back to Chicago, that's where we'll be staying.",

I decided I could overlook the intense club-like vibe and overwhelming cologne smell in the lobby... because who doesn't want to stay in a spaceship for a few nights? \r\nThen came my second visit, two words: bad dream. First of all, a warning: If you value sleep do not stay on the --th floor. There is a club on the --th and you can count on the noise going until at least -:--am (I should note, I am not a light sleeper). Today, after a long day of meetings I was looking forward to coming up to my room to relax, NOT SO FAST! Guess what? The walls are paper thin! You idiot, you just moved to the fourth floor but you had better pray that your neighbors are quiet and go to bed at a reasonable hour, or that you have the same taste in music. If like me, however, they decided to crank up the techno music and bring the party to their room, count yourself in as their plus one and hang on for a ride into the middle of the night listening to your walls shake as they yell to be heard. \r\nI should note: I called the front desk and they sent security, this didn't really do much. The biggest issue is honestly the paper thin walls. It is kind of unreal how much you can hear, every word (so if you plan on having sex or private conversations, take note it will be a community experience for your neighbors).\r\nAt this point, I am beyond exhausted. I am paying a premium and haven't slept in two days. Being a frequent business traveller to NYC, I love a good deal that is in this neighborhood, but at this rate you couldn't pay me to return to the dream downtown.\r\nYes it's trendy, yes you might think $----$--- a night is a good deal... but do not be fooled. Unless your only plan is to party all night and sleep during the day (when it actually was quite peaceful) find another location!\r\nDream hotel = disaster.",

The bathroom was also miniscule with just a stall shower with no tub, and it smelled musty because there's no ventilation. When I complained about the smell which was reminiscent of old, wet towels, they sent someone from housekeeping to spray some heavily perfumed air freshener which just made it worse.

I don't know if I got stuck with a room that has yet to be renovated or if they just did a shabby job at renovating my room. There were stains on the furniture and all sorts of hair on the bed when I arrived. The hair was definitely not my own! There was trash throughout the room that was presumably left by the person(s) who stayed in the room before me which housekeeping overlooked before I arrived. It is not very welcoming to arrive in a hotel room that is more or less dirty. My coworker also stayed at the hotel and that room was cleaner and nicer than mine. \r\nOn the plus side the room was spacious as was the bathroom. The hotel is situated downtown near restaurants and shopping. There were lots of dining options. I was at the hotel for less than -- hours so I didn't experience the rest of the hotel.

			"originalText": "The property itself is clean, well-presented and well-maintained. However, for an airport hotel, and a property which does a great deal\r\nof it's business with flight crews, it certainly does not go out of it's way to ensure that the crews are indulged. \r\nWe are Marriott Rewards customers (albeit the basic level), and were assigned a room on the ground floor - with a very narrow door, making\r\nit hard to push our luggage through. This was almost laughable since the rooms on the opposite side of the hall had standard sized doors. \r\nAs other reviewers have noted, internet access is charged at $--.-- plus tax per day ... and parking is $--! So, a relatively inexpensive\r\nroom rate is pushed up substantially by the add-ons. So, if you have no car, and no need to use the internet - then this hotel is a relative bargain; if you need those accoutrement then the price rises\r\nrapidly - and I would recommend the Doubletree down off of Sepulveda.\r\nThe other matter I took issue with during my stay was the large gathering that was held the morning of our departure. Since we were on the ground floor, and since there was an entry-exit at the end of our hall, it became very noisy in the morning as the group filed in, and furthermore, many members of that group were smokers so the hall was quite malodorous by the time we departed. Apparently, no effort was made to prevent the attendees from smoking in the lodging hallways.\r\nOn the bright side, corporate policy allows for a - PM departure upon\r\nrequest - although that is done via the internet before one's arrival.\r\nIn summary, I would like to compliment the staff - to a person, they were pleasant and affable. To the management - rather than nickel-and-diming your flight crews, why not bundle everything so they will want to visit your property when traveling on leisure? \r\nIn all honesty, I probably would not return. More because I was disenchanted with the ground level room and the noise than for any other reason. Otherwise, it has the feel of a mid-level airport hotel.",

And true, the location was great - we walked everywhere (Central Park, Chrysler Building, Broadway, etc). The room was indeed newly renovated, but some of it felt like surface make-up. Bits of paint appeared slapped on and was starting to peel off, covering the carpet in small white dots of paint. There was a bit of chewing gum stuck on our bathroom door. The toiletries were nice but not replaced on our second day.There were small hairs stuck to our bathroom door and wall which never got removed. The desk lamp cable was disconnected with no outlet in sight (I found some in the bathroom), the desk drawer was broken and my bed wasn't made properly.\r\nThe room temperature showed -- degrees and I admit I'm no genius with thermostats but I usually make them work eventually. Here, I only managed to get cold air and decided to live with it the first night but in the morning my mum had placed a towel over her duvet as she was cold (there was a small draught coming in from the window and no extra rugs or duvet). I called reception and was told that maybe it wasn't cold enough to put on the heat but he would send someone up in a minute or two. We waited -- minutes in vain and left to get breakfast. If the tech person showed up, (s)he did so while we were away. \r\nI don't know what to make of this hotel. I might stay there again as everything else in the area is so expensive and I can live with little faults - I am after all not in NY to sit all day in my room and I am sure there's far worse out there - but it irks me that the cleaning is not quite up to scratch.",

Lesson learnt - if you're planning to use UK electrical equipment, don't forget to bring an adapter with you!",

			"originalText": "So many disheartening problems with this hotel that I'll just list them:\r\n-. Our reservation for a queen-bedded room @ $---.-night turned out to be a room without a bath - just a shower. Hotel now wanted $---. for a room with a bathtub. Only king-bedded rooms have bathtubs but hotel does not tell you this unless you ask. It was hard work on our part to convince the hotel to give us a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"bathtubbed room\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" for the advertised price of $---. Finally, they gave it to us @ $---. but only for one night of the four nights we'd booked. This king-bedded room was very pretty but its bathtub was a half-bathtub (a.k.a. 'hip bath'). You can only sit upright in it, knees in the air, but you cannot stretch out.\r\n-. On day #-, @$---., we came back at the end of the day to a completely unmade room. The desk guy belligerently barked at me, \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"I DON\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"T make beds!\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" twice, and then \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"I don't know HOW to make beds!\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" and \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"What do you EXPECT me to do?!\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" when I told him the problem. We despaired and asked for clean towels. He didn't want to take away the dirty ones and sighed at this. He stomped and pouted in time while emptying the bins. The next morning he told me I was very rude for TELLING him after the housekeeping staff had gone, that we expected our room to be cleaned. Neither he or the management ever said 'Sorry\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\".\r\n-. On day #-, we still hadn't been given a single bar of soap. Today there was no Kleenex or toilet paper. We had to go get it ourselves.\r\n-. On day #-, we arrived back at night to discover the toilet had not been cleaned. And it nearly overflowed when we flushed it. I called the desk about this immediately. Back came the emphatically pained response of \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Oh nooooo\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\". No 'thank you' whatsoever.\r\nThe beds are comfortable, the elevator rickety and its whirring sounds audible in nearby rooms. The rooms are peaceful-looking. The decor is more late --'s suburban than art deco; the lobby is more authentic. If it weren't for employees who delight in offering non-service, and housekeeping staff who don't care about their jobs, the place would have been kinda pleasant. The only Philadelphians who weren't nice seemed to all have jobs at this hotel!\r\nOn check-out, the manager gave us one free night in compensation for poor service. But I'm still wondering, \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Why does this hotel in Philadelphia cost $--.-night more than our room in a --th. century townhouse in the Marais in Paris with a balcony, authentic furnishings, French-milled soaps, chandelier, and impeccable service, even free umbrellas for sudden rainfall?\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" Next time in Philly, I will curb my expectation of style, my penchant for independent hotels.

But their check in procedures and restaurant food (at least for breakfast) need SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT! Oh not to mention the random noises made by the AC unit at night!

			"originalText": "I would recommend anyone thinking of staying in this hotel to reconsider immediately and stay at the nearby Hudson hotel instead. \r\nAlthough we had booked a 'Superior Room', the room was tiny and most of the furniture fittings and wall coverings had seen better days. On the website the rooms looked spacious light and airy. In reality they were small gloomy and grubby. We had to lift our suitcases over the bed of the L shaped room as there was not room to wheel them past. After looking at the room we called the front desk to ask if alternatives were available. After - attempted calls when the phone went unanswered we finally got through and expressed our disappointment. We were offered a larger room on a higher floor, although we were warned that it did not 'have a view'. The current 'view from the room we were currently in was of the back of a building and a car park, so we decided to take the risk.\r\nThe next room we were given had more room only in that the bed was barely bigger than a single, the desk and chair had been removed and the TV was half the size of the previous room. There was not even room anywhere for the coffee machine which had been situated in the bathroom. There was no wardrobe, but there was a small single sized built in cupboard housing electrical and telephone switchgear with a small rail. Although we had booked a room with 'free' WiFi, it did not reach this room, and without a desk I would have been unable to do any work or use my laptop.\r\nI attempted to contact the front desk once more and after another - calls which were unanswered again got through to the front desk. I explained that this room was in no way 'superior' and was in fact smaller and less well equipped than the previous room. I was told that no other rooms were available, but that if we wanted to move back to the first room we were offered I could do so. However I was advised that for an additional $--- we could upgrade to a suite the following day, when bookings were 'wide open'. By this time we were now running late for a dinner appointment, so we agreed to stay in the current room, on condition we could move to a suite the following day. We were told that if we packed our suitcases in the morning when we left the hotel staff would move them to a suite the following afternoon, and we could collect keys when we returned in the evening.\r\nThe following morning on leaving the hotel for the day, we handed back our keys asked for confirmation of the move to a suite. We were told in a very offhand manner that there was no possibility of such a move as the hotel was fully booked. The desk clerk disputed that we could have been told the above information about a room change. We then asked to speak to the duty manager who was quite frankly very rude, and was completely unconcerned that our weekend was being ruined. By this time staff had lied to me twice, about the move to the 'bigger' room the previous day, and about a suite being available today. I noticed the manager was smirking at my annoyance and I suggested that this was inappropriate and she laughed in my face. This suggested to me that this staff attitude permeates the hotel, and that no one has any genuine wish to look after their guests needs or satisfaction.\r\nAs a frequent business and leisure traveler I have never before experienced such a terrible product, or staff who give the impression that they are completely unconcerned about customer care and satisfaction. I the attitude of the (female) duty manager on the morning of Saturday - June was completely unacceptable for someone in the service and hospitality industry and I cannot understand how on earth she was ever given a position of responsibility. \r\n Luckily we moved to the Hudson hotel, which for a similar room rate was in a totally different league, and the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. When we advised the manger that we were checking out early, she had the audacity to ask what was wrong, and indicated we would be charged for an additional night even though we had spent less that -- hrs in the hotel and were checking out at --am. It was only after further discussion when I indicated I would dispute the charge on my credit card that this was dropped.\r\nThe front desk staff and duty manager on Friday - June and particularly Sat - June are quite possibly the worst I have ever encountered.\r\nI would suggest that as any prospective customers of On the Ave hotel choose the Hudson rather than this, dowdy and shabby establishment populated by rude and unpleasant staff.",

			"originalText": "Stayed at the Legacy Golf Resort for a night in late September as a stopover on a cross country trip. Booked the hotel through hotwire, so it was a reasonable price. \r\nThe grounds and facilities are decent enough, check-in was pretty smooth and there were no major complaints. However, the hotel is a fair distance away from the interstate. Keep that in mind if you're staying for just a night or passing through. If you're staying for a few days and playing golf, the proximity of the interstate probably isn't a big deal. In addition to being a distance away from the interstate, the place was a little difficult to locate, its behind some small farms, etc., and not in a place where you'd expect to find a hotel. \r\nAside from the location, this place wasn't really anything special. The decor was a little dated and cheesy looking, and you can tell its a timeshare golf condo rather than a hotel room. We didn't use any of the kitchen facilities since we were just staying for a night. They were installing something in the room next to ours and there was some noise from drilling and hammering while we were staying there, which was fortunately not during hours when we were sleeping. Also our doorbell was randomly rang at - AM and no one was there when we got up and looked...since there isn't any real security and anyone can get on the grounds, we were a little suspcious of that. \r\nAll in all, not terrible for a night's stay, but nothing special. I think it would be more appealing if you were staying a few nights or using the facility for a golf vacation, since its not too close to the interstate.",
